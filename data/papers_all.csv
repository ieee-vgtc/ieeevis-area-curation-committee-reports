"The spatial time series generated by city sensors allow us to observe urban phenomena like environmental pollution and traffic congestion at an unprecedented scale. However, recovering causal relations from these observations to explain the sources of urban phenomena remains a challenging task because these causal relations tend to be time-varying and demand proper time series partitioning for effective analyses. The prior approaches extract one causal graph given long-time observations, which cannot be directly applied to capturing, interpreting, and validating dynamic urban causality. This paper presents Compass, a novel visual analytics approach for in-depth analyses of the dynamic causality in urban time series. To develop Compass, we identify and address three challenges: detecting urban causality, interpreting dynamic causal relations, and unveiling suspicious causal relations. First, multiple causal graphs over time among urban time series are obtained with a causal detection framework extended from the Granger causality test. Then, a dynamic causal graph visualization is designed to reveal the time-varying causal relations across these causal graphs and facilitate the exploration of the graphs along the time. Finally, a tailored multi-dimensional visualization is developed to support the identification of spurious causal relations, thereby improving the reliability of causal analyses. The effectiveness of Compass is evaluated with two case studies conducted on the real-world urban datasets, including the air pollution and traffic speed datasets, and positive feedback was received from domain experts.",Compass: Towards Better Causal Analysis of Urban Time Series,,A&D,2021
"Visual Question Answering systems target answering open-ended textual questions given input images. They are a testbed for learning high-level reasoning with a primary use in HCI, for instance assistance for the visually impaired. Recent research has shown that state-of-the-art models tend to produce answers exploiting biases and shortcuts in the training data, and sometimes do not even look at the input image, instead of performing the required reasoning steps. We present VisQA, a visual analytics tool that explores this question of reasoning vs. bias exploitation. It exposes the key element of state-of-the-art neural models --- attention maps in transformers. Our working hypothesis is that reasoning steps leading to model predictions are observable from attention distributions, which are particularly useful for visualization. The design process of VisQA was motivated by well-known bias examples from the fields of deep learning and vision-language reasoning and evaluated in two ways. First, as a result of a collaboration of three fields, machine learning, vision and language reasoning, and data analytics, the work lead to a better understanding of bias exploitation of neural models for VQA, which eventually resulted in an impact on its design and training through the proposition of a method for the transfer of reasoning patterns from an oracle model. Second, we also report on the design of VisQA, and a goal-oriented evaluation of VisQA targeting the analysis of a model decision process from multiple experts, providing evidence that it makes the inner workings of models accessible to users.",VisQA: X-raying Vision and Language Reasoning in Transformers,,App,2021
"Table2Text systems generate textual output based on structured data utilizing machine learning. These systems are essential for fluent natural language interfaces in tools such as virtual assistants; however, left to generate freely these ML systems often produce misleading or unexpected outputs. GenNI (Generation Negotiation Interface) is an interactive visual system for high-level human-AI collaboration in producing descriptive text. The tool utilizes a deep learning model designed with explicit control states. These controls allow users to globally constrain model generations, without sacrificing the representation power of the deep learning models. The visual interface makes it possible for users to interact with AI systems following a Refine-Forecast paradigm to ensure that the generation system acts in a manner human users find suitable. We report multiple use cases on two experiments that improve over uncontrolled generation approaches, while at the same time providing fine-grained control.",GenNI: Human-AI Collaboration for Data-Backed Text Generation,,A&D,2021
"Supporting the translation from natural language (NL) to visualization (NL2VIS) can simplify the creation of data visualizations, because if successful, anyone can generate visualizations by their natural language. The state-of-the-art NL2VIS approaches (e.g., NL4DV and FlowSense) are based on semantic parsers and heuristic algorithms, which are not end-to-end and are not designed for supporting (possibly) complex data transformations. Deep neural network powered neural machine translation models have made great strides in many machine translation tasks, which suggests that they might be viable for NL2VIS as well. In this paper, we present ncNet, a Transformer-based sequence-to-sequence model for supporting NL2VIS, with several novel visualization-aware optimizations, including using attention-forcing to optimize the learning process, and visualization-aware rendering to produce better visualization result. To enhance the capability of machine to comprehend natural language queries, ncNet is also designed to take an optional chart template (e.g., a pie chart or a scatter plot) as input, where the chart template will be served as a constraint to limit what could be visualized. We conducted both quantitative evaluation and user study, showing that neural machine translation techniques are easy-to-use and achieve good accuracy that is comparable with the state-of-the-art NL2SQL result.",Natural Language to Visualization by Neural Machine Translation,,R&I,2021
"Multimodal sentiment analysis aims to recognize people’s attitudes from
  multiple communication channels such as verbal content (i.e., text), voice, and facial expressions. It has become a vibrant and important research topic in natural language processing. Much research focuses on modeling the complex intra- and inter-modal interactions between different communication channels.
  However, current multimodal models with strong performance are often deep-learning-based techniques and work like black boxes.
  It is not clear how models utilize multimodal information for sentiment predictions.
  Despite recent advances in techniques for enhancing the explainability of machine learning models, they often target unimodal scenarios (e.g., images, sentences),
  and little research has been done on explaining multimodal models.
  In this paper, we present an interactive visual analytics system, M2Lens, to visualize and explain multimodal models for sentiment analysis. M2Lens provides explanations on intra- and inter-modal interactions at the global, subset, and local levels. Specifically, it summarizes the influence of three typical interaction types (i.e., dominance, complement, and conflict) on the model predictions. 
  Moreover, M2Lens identifies frequent and influential multimodal features and supports the multi-faceted exploration of model behaviors from language, acoustic, and visual modalities.
  Through two case studies and expert interviews, we demonstrate our system can help users gain deep insights into the multimodal models for sentiment analysis.",M^2Lens: Visualizing and Explaining Multimodal Models for Sentiment Analysis,,A&D,2021
"Model checkers provide algorithms for proving that a mathematical model of a system satisfies a given specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other. We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample. Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically, we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.",Visual Analysis of Hyperproperties for Understanding Model Checking Results,,App,2021
"One of the fundamental tasks in visualization is to compare two or more visual elements. However, it is often difficult to visually differentiate graphical elements encoding a small difference in value, such as the heights of similar bars in bar chart or angles of similar sections in pie chart. Perceptual laws can be used in order to model when and how we perceive this difference. In this work, we model the perception of Just Noticeable Differences (JNDs), the minimum difference in visual attributes that allow faithfully comparing similar elements, in charts. Specifically, we explore the relation between JNDs and two major visual variables: the intensity of visual elements and the distance between them, and study it in three charts: bar chart, pie chart and bubble chart. Through an empirical study, we identify main effects on JND for distance in bar charts, intensity in pie charts, and both distance and intensity in bubble charts. By fitting a linear mixed effects model, we model JND and find that JND grows as the exponential function of variables. We highlight several usage scenarios that make use of the JND modeling in which elements below the fitted JND are detected and enhanced with secondary visual cues for better discrimination.",Modeling Just Noticeable Differences in Charts,,T&E,2021
"Charts go hand in hand with text to communicate complex data and are widely adopted in news articles, online blogs, and academic papers. They provide graphical summaries of the data, while text explains the message and context. However, synthesizing information across text and charts is difficult; it requires readers to frequently shift their attention. We investigated ways to support the tight coupling of text and charts in data documents. To understand their interplay, we analyzed the design space of such references through news articles and scientific papers. Informed by the analysis, we developed a mixed-initiative interface enabling users to construct interactive references between text and charts. It leverages natural language processing to automatically suggest references as well as allows users to manually construct other references effortlessly. A user study complemented with algorithmic evaluation of the system suggests that the interface provides an effective way to compose interactive data documents.",Kori: Interactive Synthesis of Text and Charts in Data Documents,,R&I,2021
"Graph mining is an essential component of recommender systems and search engines. Outputs of graph mining models typically provide a ranked list sorted by each item's relevance or utility. However, recent research has identified issues of algorithmic bias in such models, and new graph mining algorithms have been proposed to correct for bias. 
  As such, algorithm developers need tools that can help them uncover potential biases in their models while also exploring the impacts of correcting for biases when employing fairness-aware algorithms. In this paper, we present FairRankVis, a visual analytics framework designed to enable the exploration of multi-class bias in graph mining algorithms. We support both group and individual fairness levels of comparison. Our framework is designed to enable model developers to compare multi-class fairness between algorithms (for example, comparing PageRank with a debiased PageRank algorithm) to assess the impacts of algorithmic debiasing with respect to group and individual fairness. We demonstrate our framework through two usage scenarios inspecting algorithmic fairness.",FairRankVis: A Visual Analytics Framework for Exploring Algorithmic Fairness in Graph Mining Models,,App,2021
"Scatterplots can encode a third dimension by using additional channels like size or color (e.g. bubble charts). We explore a potential misinterpretation of trivariate scatterplots, which we call the weighted average illusion, where locations of larger and darker points are given more weight toward x- and y-mean estimates. This systematic bias is sensitive to a designer’s choice of size or lightness ranges mapped onto the data. In this paper, we quantify this bias against varying size/lightness ranges and data correlations. We discuss possible explanations for its cause by measuring attention given to individual data points using a vision science technique called the centroid method. Our work illustrates how ensemble processing mechanisms and mental shortcuts can significantly distort visual summaries of data, and can lead to misjudgments like the demonstrated weighted average illusion.",The Weighted Average Illusion: Biases in Perceived Mean Position in Scatterplots,,T&E,2021
"The interpretation of deep neural networks (DNNs) has become a key topic as more people apply them to solve various problems and making critical decisions. Recently, concept-based explanation has become a popular approach for post-hoc interpretation of DNNs. Instead of focusing on a single data sample to obtain local interpretation such as saliency maps, concept-based explanation provides a global interpretation of model predictions by analyzing how visual concepts affects model decision. For example, how the presence of shadow affects an object detection model. However, identifying human-friendly visual concepts that affect model decisions is a challenging task that can not be easily addressed with automatic approaches. In this paper, we present a novel human-in-the-loop visual analytics framework to generate user-defined concepts for model interpretation and diagnostics. The core of our approach is the use of active learning, where we integrate human knowledge and feedback to train a concept extractor in each stage. We crop or segment the original images into small image patches, extract the latent presentations from the hidden layer of the task model, select image patches sharing a common concept, and train a shallow net on top of the latent representation to collect image patches containing the visual concept. We combine these processes into an interactive system, ConceptExtract. Through two case studies, we show how our approach helps analyze model behavior and extract human-friendly concepts for different machine learning tasks and datasets and how to use these concepts to understand the predictions, compare model performance and make suggestions for model refinement. Quantitative experiments show that our active learning approach can accurately extract meaningful visual concepts. More importantly, by identifying visual concepts that negatively affect model performance, we develop the corresponding data augmentation strategy that consistently improves model performance.",Human-in-the-loop Extraction of Interpretable Concepts in Deep Learning Models,,A&D,2021
"We introduce Diatoms, a technique that generates design inspiration for glyphs by sampling from palettes of mark shapes, encoding channels, and glyph scaffold shapes. Diatoms allows for a degree of randomness while respecting constraints imposed by columns in a data table: their data types and domains as well as semantic associations between columns as specified by the designer. We pair this generative design process with two forms of interactive design externalization that enable comparison and critique of the design alternatives. First, we incorporate a familiar small multiples configuration in which every data point is drawn according to a single glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between alternative glyph designs. Second, we propose a small permutables design gallery, in which a single data point is drawn according to each alternative glyph design, coupled with the ability to page between data points. We demonstrate an implementation of our technique as an extension to Tableau featuring three example palettes, and to better understand how Diatoms could fit into existing design workflows, we conducted interviews and chauffeured demos with 12 designers. Finally, we reflect on our process and the designers’ reactions, discussing the potential of our technique in the context of visualization authoring systems. Ultimately, our approach to glyph design and comparison can kickstart and inspire visualization design, allowing for the serendipitous discovery of shape and channel combinations that would have otherwise been overlooked.",Generative Design Inspiration for Glyphs with Diatoms,,R&I,2021
"Visual information displays are typically composed of multiple visualizations that are used to facilitate an understanding of the underlying data. A common example are dashboards, which are frequently used in domains such as finance, process monitoring and business intelligence. However, users may not be aware of existing guidelines and lack expert design knowledge when composing such multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present semantic snapping, an approach to help non-expert users design effective multi-view visualizations from sets of pre-existing views. When a particular view is placed on a canvas, it is ""aligned'' with the remaining views--not with respect to its geometric layout, but based on aspects of the visual encoding itself, such as how data dimensions are mapped to channels. Our method uses an on-the-fly procedure to detect and suggest resolutions for conflicting, misleading, or ambiguous designs, as well as to provide suggestions for alternative presentations. With this approach, users can be guided to avoid common pitfalls encountered when composing visualizations. Our provided examples and case studies demonstrate the usefulness and validity of our approach.",Semantic Snapping for Guided Multi-View Visualization Design,,R&I,2021
"In theory, efficient and high-quality rendering of unstructured data should greatly benefit from modern GPUs, but in practice, GPUs are often limited by the large amount of memory that large meshes require for element representation and for sample reconstruction acceleration structures. We describe a memory-optimized encoding for large unstructured meshes that efficiently encodes both the unstructured mesh and corresponding sample reconstruction acceleration structure, while still allowing for fast random-access sampling as required for rendering. We demonstrate that for large data our encoding is more efficient than OSPRay’s and allows for rendering even the 2.9 billion element Mars Lander on a single off-the-shelf GPU--and the largest 6.3 billion version on a pair of such GPUs.",A Memory Efficient Encoding for Ray Tracing Large Unstructured Data,,DTr,2021
"Node-link visualizations are a familiar and powerful tool for displaying the relationships in a network. The readability of these visualizations highly depends on the spatial layout used for the nodes. In this paper, we focus on computing layered layouts, in which nodes are aligned on a set of parallel axes to better expose hierarchical or sequential relationships. Heuristic-based layouts are widely used as they scale well to larger networks and usually create readable, albeit sub-optimal, visualizations. We instead use a layout optimization model that prioritizes optimality (as compared to scalability) because an optimal solution not only represents the best attainable result, but can also serve as a baseline to evaluate the effectiveness of layout heuristics. We take an important step towards powerful and flexible network visualization by proposing Stratisfimal Layout, a modular integer-linear-programming formulation that can consider several important readability criteria simultaneously: crossing reduction, edge bendiness, and nested and multi-layer groups. The layout can be adapted to diverse use cases through its modularity. Individual features can be enabled and customized depending on the application. We provide open-source and documented implementations of the layout, both for web-based and desktop visualizations. As a proof-of-concept, we apply it to the problem of visualizing complicated SQL queries, which have features that, to the best of our knowledge, cannot be addressed by existing layout optimization models. We also include a benchmark network generator and the results of an empirical evaluation to assess the performance trade-offs of our design choices.

"What makes speeches effective has long been a subject for debate, and until today there is broad controversy among public speaking experts about what factors make a speech effective as well as the roles of these factors in speeches. Moreover, there is a lack of quantitative analysis methods to help understand effective speaking strategies. In this paper, we propose E-ffective, a visual analytic system allowing speaking experts and novices to analyze both the role of speech factors and their contribution in effective speeches. From interviews with domain experts and investigating existing literature, we figured out important factors to consider in inspirational speeches. We obtained the generated factors from multi-modal data that were then related to effectiveness data. Our system supports rapid understanding of critical factors in inspirational speeches, including the influence of emotions by means of novel visualization methods and interaction. Two novel visualizations include E-spiral (that shows the emotional shifts in speeches in a visually compact way) and E-script (that connects speech content with key speech delivery information). In our evaluation we studied the influence of our system on experts' domain knowledge about speech factors. We further studied the usability of the system by speaking novices and experts on assisting analysis of inspirational speech effectiveness.",E-ffective: A Visual Analytic System for Exploring the Emotion and Effectiveness of Inspirational Speeches,,App,2021
"Alternative text is critical in communicating graphics to people who are blind or have low vision. Especially for graphics that contain rich information, such as visualizations, poorly written or an absence of alternative texts can worsen the information access inequality for people with visual impairments. In this work, we consolidate existing guidelines and survey current practices to inspect to what extent current practices and recommendations are aligned. Then, to gain more insight into what people want in visualization alternative texts, we interviewed 22 people with visual impairments regarding their experience with visualizations and their information needs in alternative texts. The study findings suggest that participants actively try to construct an image of visualizations in their head while listening to alternative texts and wish to carry out visualization tasks (e.g., retrieve specific values) as sighted viewers would. The study also provides ample support for the need to reference the underlying data instead of visual elements to reduce users’ cognitive burden. Informed by the study, we provide a set of recommendations to compose an informative alternative text.",Communicating Visualizations without Visuals: Investigation of Visualization Alternative Text for People with Visual Impairments,,T&E,2021
"Despite the rising popularity of automated visualization tools, existing systems tend to provide direct results which do not always fit the input data or meet visualization requirements. Therefore, additional specification adjustments are still required in real-world use cases. However, manual adjustments are difficult since most users do not necessarily possess adequate skills or visualization knowledge. Even experienced users might create imperfect visualizations that involve chart construction errors. We present a framework, VizFixer, to help users detect flaws and rectify already-built but defective visualizations. The framework consists of two components, (1) a visualization linter, which applies well-recognized principles to inspect the legitimacy of rendered visualizations, and (2) a visualization fixer, which automatically corrects the detected violations according to the linter. We implement the framework into an online editor prototype based on Vega-Lite specifications. To further evaluate the system, we conduct an in-lab user study. The results prove its effectiveness and efficiency in identifying and fixing errors for data visualizations.",VizLinter: A Linter and Fixer Framework for Data Visualization,,S&R,2021
"Dimensionality Reduction (DR) techniques can generate 2D projections and enable visual exploration of cluster structures of high-dimensional datasets. However, different DR techniques would yield various patterns, which significantly affect the performance of visual cluster analysis tasks. We present the results of a user study that investigates the influence of different DR techniques on visual cluster analysis. Our study focuses on the most concerned property types, namely the linearity and locality, and evaluates twelve representative DR techniques that cover the concerned properties. Four controlled experiments were conducted to evaluate how the DR techniques facilitate the tasks of 1) identifying clusters, 2) associating cluster members, 3) comparing distances among clusters, and 4) comparing cluster densities, respectively. We also evaluated users’ subjective preference of the DR techniques regarding the quality of projected clusters. The results show that: 1) Non-linear and Local techniques are preferred in identifying clusters and associating cluster members; 2) Linear techniques perform better than non-linear techniques in comparing cluster densities; 3) UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) and t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding) perform the best in identifying clusters and associating cluster members; 4) NMF(Nonnegative Matrix Factorization) has competitive performance in comparing distances among clusters; 5) t-SNLE(t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Linear Embedding) has competitive performance in comparing cluster densities.",Revisiting Dimensionality Reduction Techniques for Visual Cluster Analysis: An Empirical Study,,T&E,2021
"Labels, short textual annotations are an important component of data visualizations, illustrations, infographics, and geographical maps. In interactive applications, the labeling method responsible for positioning the labels should not take the resources from the application itself. In other words, the labeling method should provide the result as fast as possible. In this work, we propose a greedy point-feature labeling method running on GPU. In contrast to existing methods that position the labels sequentially, the proposed method positions several labels in parallel. Yet, we guarantee that the positioned labels will not overlap, nor will they overlap important visual features. When the proposed method is searching for the label position of a point-feature, the available label candidates are evaluated with respect to overlaps with important visual features, conflicts with label candidates of other point-features, and their ambiguity. The evaluation of each label candidate is done in constant time independently from the number of point-features, the number of important visual features, and the resolution of the created image. Our measurements indicate that the proposed method is able to position more labels than existing greedy methods that do not evaluate conflicts between the label candidates. At the same time, the proposed method achieves a significant increase in performance. The increase in performance is mainly due to the parallelization and the efficient evaluation of label candidates.",Rapid Labels: Point-Feature Labeling on GPU,,S&R,2021
"We present an exploratory analysis of gender representation among the authors, committee members, and award winners at the IEEE Visualization (VIS) conference over the last 30 years. Our goal is to provide descriptive data on which diversity discussions and efforts in the community can build. We look in particular at the gender of VIS authors as a proxy for the community at large. We consider measures of overall gender representation among authors, differences in careers, positions in author lists, and collaborations. We found that the proportion of female authors has increased from 9% in the first five years to 22% in the last five years of the conference. Over the years, we found the same representation of women in program committees and slightly more women in organizing committees. Women are less likely to appear in the last author position, but more in the middle positions. In terms of collaboration patterns, female authors tend to collaborate more than expected with other women in the community.

"Working with data in table form is usually considered a preparatory and tedious step in the sensemaking pipeline; a way of getting the data ready for more sophisticated visualization and analytical tools. But for many people, spreadsheets — the quintessential table tool — remain a critical part of their information ecosystem, allowing them to interact with their data in ways that are hidden or abstracted in more complex tools. This is particularly true for data workers [61], people who work with data as part of their job but do not identify as professional analysts or data scientists. We report on a qualitative study of how these workers interact with and reason about their data. Our findings show that data tables serve a broader purpose beyond data cleanup at the initial stage of a linear analytic flow: users want to see and “get their hands on” the underlying data throughout the analytics process, reshaping and augmenting it to support sensemaking. They reorganize, mark up, layer on levels of detail, and spawn alternatives within the context of the base data. These direct interactions and human-readable table representations form a rich and cognitively important part of building understanding of what the data mean and what they can do with it. We argue that interactive tables are an important visualization idiom in their own right; that the direct data interaction they afford offers a fertile design space for visual analytics; and that sense making can be enriched by more flexible human-data interaction than is currently supported in visual analytics tools.",Untidy Data: The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Tables,,T&E,2021
"Machine learning (ML) is increasingly applied to Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to solve clinical prediction tasks. Although many ML models perform promisingly, issues with model transparency and interpretability limit their adoption in clinical practice. Directly using existing explainable ML techniques in clinical settings can be challenging. Through literature surveys and collaborations with six clinicians with an average of 17 years of clinical experience, we identified three key challenges, including clinicians' unfamiliarity with ML features, lack of contextual information, and the need for cohort-level evidence. Following an iterative design process, we further designed and developed VBridge, a visual analytics tool that seamlessly incorporates ML explanations into clinicians' decision-making workflow. The system includes a novel hierarchical display of contribution-based feature explanations and enriched interactions that connect the dots between ML features, explanations, and data. We demonstrated the effectiveness of VBridge through two case studies and expert interviews with four clinicians, showing that visually associating model explanations with patients' situational records can help clinicians better interpret and use model predictions when making clinician decisions. We further derived a list of design implications for developing future explainable ML tools to support clinical decision-making.",VBridge: Connecting the Dots Between Features and Data to Explain Healthcare Models,,A&D,2021
"Existing research on making sense of deep neural networks often focuses on neuron-level interpretation, which may not adequately capture the bigger picture of how concepts are collectively encoded by multiple neurons. We present NeuroCartography, an interactive system that scalably summarizes and visualizes concepts learned by neural networks. It automatically discovers and groups neurons that detect the same concepts, and describes how such neuron groups interact to form higher-level concepts and the subsequent predictions. NeuroCartography introduces two scalable summarization techniques: (1) neuron clustering groups neurons based on the semantic similarity of the concepts detected by neurons (e.g., neurons detecting “dog faces” of different breeds are grouped); and (2) neuron embedding encodes the associations between related concepts based on how often they co-occur (e.g., neurons detecting “dog face” and “dog tail” are placed closer in the embedding space). Key to our scalable techniques is the ability to efficiently compute all neuron pairs’ relationships, in time linear to the number of neurons instead of quadratic time. NeuroCartography scales to large data, such as the ImageNet dataset with 1.2M images. The system’s tightly coordinated views integrate the scalable techniques to visualize the concepts and their relationships, projecting the concept associations to a 2D space in Neuron Projection View, and summarizing neuron clusters and their relationships in Graph View. Through a large-scale human evaluation, we demonstrate that our technique discovers neuron groups that represent coherent, human-meaningful concepts. And through usage scenarios, we describe how our approaches enable interesting and surprising discoveries, such as concept cascades of related and isolated concepts. The NeuroCartography visualization runs in modern browsers and is open-sourced.",NeuroCartography: Scalable Automatic Visual Summarization of Concepts in Deep Neural Networks,,A&D,2021
"t-distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding (t-SNE) has become a standard for exploratory data analysis, as it is capable of revealing clusters even in complex data while requiring minimal user input. While its run-time complexity limited it to small datasets in the past, recent efforts improved upon the expensive similarity computations and the previously quadratic minimization. Nevertheless, t-SNE still has high runtime and memory costs when operating on millions of points. We present a novel method for executing the t-SNE minimization. While our method overall retains a linear runtime complexity, we obtain a significant performance increase in the most expensive part of the minimization. We achieve a significant improvement without a noticeable decrease in accuracy even when targeting a 3D embedding. Our method constructs a pair of spatial hierarchies over the embedding, which are simultaneously traversed to approximate many N-body interactions at once. We demonstrate an efficient GPGPU implementation and evaluate its performance against state-of-the-art methods on a variety of datasets.",An Efficient Dual-Hierarchy tSNE Minimization,,DTr,2021
"In the study of packed granular materials, the performance of a sample (e.g., the detonation of a high-energy explosive) often correlates to measurements of a fluid flowing through it. The “effective surface area,” the surface area accessible to the airflow, is typically measured using a permeametry apparatus that relates the flow conductance to the permeable surface area via the Carman-Kozeny equation. This equation allows calculating the flow rate of a fluid flowing through the granules packed in the sample for a given pressure drop. However, Carman-Kozeny makes inherent assumptions about tunnel shapes and flow paths that may not accurately hold in situations where the particles possess a wide distribution in shapes, sizes, and aspect ratios, as is true with many powdered systems of technological and commercial interest. To address this challenge, we replicate these measurements virtually on micro-CT images of the powdered material, introducing a new Pore Network Model (PNM) based on the skeleton of the Morse-Smale complex. Pores are identified as basins of the complex, their incidence encodes adjacency, and the conductivity of the capillary between them computed from the cross-section at their interface. We build and solve a resistive network to compute an approximate laminar fluid flow through the pore structure. We provide two means of estimating flow-permeable surface area: (i) by direct computation of conductivity, and (ii) by identifying dead-ends in the flow coupled with isosurface extraction and the application of the Carman-Kozeny equation, with the aim of establishing consistency over a range of particle shapes, sizes, porosity levels, and void distribution patterns.",Towards replacing physical testing of granular materials with a Topology-based Model,,App,2021
"Prior research on communicating with visualization has focused on public presentation and asynchronous individual consumption, such as in the domain of journalism. The visualization research community knows comparatively little about synchronous and multimodal communication around data within organizations, from team meetings to executive briefings. We conducted two qualitative interview studies with individuals who prepare and deliver presentations about data to audiences in organizations. In contrast to prior work, we did not limit our interviews to those who self-identify as data analysts or data scientists. Both studies examined aspects of speaking about data with visual aids such as charts, dashboards, and tables. One study was a retrospective examination of current practices and difficulties, from which we identified three scenarios involving presentations of data. We describe these scenarios using an analogy to musical performance: small collaborative team meetings are akin to jam session, while more structured presentations can range from semi-improvisational performances among peers to formal recitals given to executives or customers. In our second study, we grounded the discussion around three design probes, each examining a different aspect of presenting data: the progressive reveal of visualization to direct attention and advance a narrative, visualization presentation controls that are hidden from the audience’s view, and the coordination of a presenter’s video with interactive visualization. Our distillation of interviewees’ responses surfaced twelve themes, from ways of authoring presentations to creating accessible and engaging audience experiences.",From Jam Session to Recital: Synchronous Communication and Collaboration Around Data in Organization,,T&E,2021
"In this paper, we report on a study of visual representations for cyclical data and the effect of interactively wrapping a bar chart ‘around its boundaries’. Compared to linear bar chart, polar (or radial) visualisations have the advantage that cyclical data can be presented continuously without mentally bridging the visual ‘cut’ across the left-and-right boundaries. To investigate this hypothesis and to assess the effect the cut has on analysis performance, this paper presents results from a crowdsourced, controlled experiment with 72 participants comparing new continuous panning technique to linear bar charts (interactive wrapping). Our results show that bar charts with interactive wrapping lead to less errors compared to standard bar charts or polar charts. Inspired by these results, we generalise the concept of interactive wrapping to other visualisations for cyclical or relational data. We describe a design space based on the concept of one-dimensional wrapping and two-dimensional wrapping, linked to two common 3D topologies; cylinder and torus that can be used to metaphorically explain one- and two-dimensional wrapping. This design space suggests that interactive wrapping is widely applicable to many different data types.",Rotate or Wrap?

"3D asymmetric tensor fields have found many applications in science and engineering domains, such as fluid dynamics and solid mechanics. 3D asymmetric tensors can have complex eigenvalues, which makes their analysis and visualization more challenging than 3D symmetric tensors. Existing research in tensor field visualization focuses on 2D asymmetric tensor fields and 3D symmetric tensor fields. In this paper, we address the analysis and visualization of 3D asymmetric tensor fields. We introduce six topological surfaces and one topological curve, which lead to an eigenvalue space based on the tensor mode that we define. In addition, we identify several non-topological feature surfaces that are nonetheless physically important. Included in our analysis are the realizations that triple degenerate tensors are structurally stable and form curves, unlike the case for 3D symmetric tensors fields. Furthermore, there are two different ways of measuring the relative strengths of rotation and angular deformation in the tensor fields, unlike the case for 2D asymmetric tensor fields. We extract these feature surfaces using the A-patches algorithm. However, since three of our feature surfaces are quadratic, we develop a method to extract quadratic surfaces at any given accuracy. To facilitate the analysis of eigenvector fields, we visualize a hyperstreamline as a tree stem with the other two eigenvectors represented as thorns in the real domain or the dual-eigenvectors as leaves in the complex domain. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our analysis and visualization, we apply our approach to datasets from solid mechanics and fluid dynamics.",Feature Curves and Surfaces of 3D Asymmetric Tensor Fields,,DTr,2021
"Visualization collections, accessed by platforms such as Tableau Online or Power BI, are used by millions of people to share and access diverse analytical knowledge in the form of interactive visualization bundles. Result snippets, compact previews of these bundles, are presented to users to help them identify relevant content when browsing collections. Our engagement with Tableau product teams and review of existing snippet designs on five platforms showed us that current practices fail to help people judge the relevance of bundles because they include only the title and one image. Users frequently need to undertake the time-consuming endeavour of opening a bundle within its visualization system to examine its many views and dashboards. In response, we contribute the first systematic approach to visualization snippet design. We propose a framework for snippet design that addresses eight key challenges that we identify. We present a computational pipeline to compress the visual and textual content of bundles into representative previews that is adaptive to a provided pixel budget and provides high information density with multiple images and carefully chosen keywords. We also reflect on the method of visual inspection through random sampling to gain confidence in model and parameter choices.",VizSnippets: Compressing Visualization Bundles Into Representative Previews for Browsing Visualization Collections,,DTr,2021
"Which drug is most promising for a cancer patient? This is a question a new microscopy-based approach for measuring the mass of individual cancer cells treated with different drugs promises to answer in only a few hours. However, the analysis pipeline for extracting data from these images is still far from complete automation: human intervention is necessary for quality control for preprocessing steps such as segmentation, to adjust filters, and remove noise, and for the analysis of the result. To address this workflow, we developed Loon, a visualization tool for analyzing drug screening data based on quantitative phase microscopy imaging. Loon visualizes both derived data such as growth rates, and imaging data. Since the images are collected automatically at a large scale, manual inspection of images and segmentations is infeasible. However, reviewing representative samples of cells is essential, both for quality control and for data analysis. We introduce a new approach of choosing and visualizing representative exemplar cells that retain a close connection to the low-level data. By tightly integrating the derived data visualization capabilities with the novel exemplar visualization and providing selection and filtering capabilities, Loon is well suited for making decisions about which drugs are suitable for a specific patient.",Loon: Using Exemplars to Visualize Large Scale Microscopy Data,,R&I,2021
"In many real-world strategic settings, people use information displays to make decisions. In these settings, an information provider chooses which information to provide to strategic agents and how to present it, and agents formulate a best response based on the information and their anticipation of how others will behave. We contribute the results of a controlled online experiment to examine how the provision and presentation of information impacts people's decisions in a congestion game. Our experiment compares how different visualization approaches for displaying this information, including bar charts and hypothetical outcome plots, and different information conditions, including where the visualized information is private versus public (i.e., available to all agents), affect decision making and welfare. We characterize the effects of visualization anticipation, referring to changes to behavior when an agent goes from alone having access to a visualization to knowing that others also have access to the visualization to guide their decisions. We also empirically identify the visualization equilibrium, i.e., the visualization for which the visualized outcome of agents' decisions matches the realized decisions of the agents who view it. We reflect on the implications of visualization equilibria and visualization anticipation for designing information displays for real-world strategic settings.",Visualization Equilibrium,,T&E,2021
"Tactic analysis is a major issue in badminton as the effective usage of tactics is the key to win. The tactic in badminton is defined as a sequence of consecutive strokes. Most existing methods use statistical models to find sequential patterns of strokes and apply 2D visualizations such as glyphs and statistical charts to explore and analyze the discovered patterns. However, in badminton, spatial information like the shuttle trajectory, which is inherently 3D, is the core of a tactic. The lack of sufficient spatial awareness in 2D visualizations largely limited the tactic analysis of badminton. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to study the tactic analysis of badminton in a 3D environment and propose an immersive visual analytics system, TIVEE, to assist users in exploring and explaining badminton tactics from multi-levels. Users can first explore various tactics from the third-person perspective using an unfolded visual presentation of stroke sequences. By selecting a tactic of interest, users can turn to the first-person perspective to perceive the detailed kinematic characteristics and explain its effects on the game result. The effectiveness and usefulness of TIVEE are demonstrated by case studies and an expert interview.",TIVEE: Visual Exploration and Explanation of Badminton Tactics in Immersive Visualizations,,App,2021
"Situated visualization is an emerging concept within information visualization, in which data is visualized in situ, where it is relevant to people. The concept has gained interest from multiple research communities, including information visualization, human-computer interaction and augmented reality. This has led to a range of explorations and applications of the concept, however, this early work has focused on the operational aspect of situatedness leading to inconsistent adoption of the concept and terminology. 
  First, we contribute a literature survey in which we analyze 40 papers that explicitly use the term ""situated visualization"" to provide an overview of the research area, how it defines situated visualization, common application areas and technology used, as well as type of data and type of visualizations. Our survey shows that research on situated visualization has focused on technology-centric approaches that forefront a spatial understanding of situatedness. 
  Secondly, we contribute five perspectives on situatedness (space, time, place, activity, and community) that expand on the prevalent notion of situatedness in the corpus. We draw from six case studies and prior theoretical developments in HCI. Each perspective develops a generative way of looking at and working with situatedness in design and research. We outline future directions, including considering technology, material and aesthetics, leveraging the perspectives for design, and methods for stronger engagement with target audiences. We conclude with opportunities to consolidate situated visualization research.",What's the Situation with Situated Visualization? A Survey and Perspectives on Situatedness,,T&E,2021
"Lithium ion batteries (LIBs) are widely used as important energy sources for mobile phones, electric vehicles, and drones. Experts have attempted to replace liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes that have wider electrochemical window and higher stability due to the potential safety risks, such as electrolyte leakage, flammable solvents, poor thermal stability, and many side reactions caused by liquid electrolytes. However, finding suitable alternative materials using traditional approaches is very difficult due to the incredibly high cost in searching. Machine learning (ML)-based methods are currently introduced and used for material prediction. However, learning tools designed for domain experts to conduct intuitive performance comparison and analysis of ML models are rare. In this case, we propose an interactive visualization system for experts to select suitable ML models and understand and explore the predication results comprehensively. Our system uses a multifaceted visualization scheme designed to support analysis from various perspectives, such as feature distribution, data similarity, model performance, and result presentation. Case studies with actual lab experiments have been conducted by the experts, and the final results confirmed the effectiveness and helpfulness of our system.",matExplorer: Visual Exploration on Predicting Ionic Conductivity for Solid-State Electrolytes,,App,2021
"We present a visual analytics tool, MiningVis, to explore the long-term historical evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that attracts much attention but remains difficult to understand. Particularly important to the success, stability, and security of Bitcoin is a component of the system called ""mining.'' Miners are responsible for validating transactions and are incentivized to participate by the promise of a monetary reward. Mining pools have emerged as collectives of miners that ensure a more stable and predictable income. MiningVis aims to help analysts understand the evolution and dynamics of the Bitcoin mining ecosystem, including mining market statistics, multi-measure mining pool rankings, and pool hopping behavior. Each of these features can be compared to external data concerning pool characteristics and Bitcoin news. In order to assess the value of MiningVis, we conducted online interviews and insight-based user studies with Bitcoin miners. We describe research questions tackled and insights made by our participants and illustrate practical implications for visual analytics systems for Bitcoin mining.",MiningVis: Visual Analytics of the Bitcoin Mining Economy,,App,2021
"Creating comprehensible visualizations of highly overlapping set-typed data is a challenging task due to its complexity. 
  To facilitate insights into set connectivity and to leverage semantic relations between intersections, we propose a fast two-step layout technique for Euler diagrams that are both well-matched and well-formed. 
  Our method conforms to established form guidelines for Euler diagrams regarding semantics, aesthetics, and readability. 
  First, we establish an initial ordering of the data, which we then use to incrementally create a planar, connected, and monotone dual graph representation. 
  In the next step, the graph is transformed into a circular layout that maintains the semantics and yields simple Euler diagrams with smooth curves. 
  When the data cannot be represented by simple diagrams, our algorithm always falls back to a solution that is not well-formed but still well-matched, whereas previous methods often fail to produce expected results. 
  We show the usefulness of our method for visualizing set-typed data using examples from text analysis and infographics. 
  Furthermore, we discuss the characteristics of our approach and evaluate our method against state-of-the-art methods.",spEuler: Semantics-preserving Euler Diagrams,,R&I,2021
"In the process of developing an infrastructure for providing visualization and visual analytics (VIS) tools to epidemiologists and modeling scientists, we encountered a technical challenge for applying a number of visual designs to numerous datasets rapidly and reliably with limited development resources. In this paper, we present a technical solution to address this challenge. Operationally, we separate the tasks of data management, visual designs, and plots and dashboard deployment in order to streamline the development workflow. Technically, we utilize: an ontology to bring datasets, visual designs, and deployable plots and dashboards under the same management framework; multi-criteria search and ranking algorithms for discovering potential datasets that match a visual design; and a purposely-design user interface for propagating each visual design to appropriate datasets (often in tens and hundreds) and quality-assuring the propagation before the deployment. This technical solution has been used in the development of the RAMPVIS infrastructure for supporting a consortium of epidemiologists and modeling scientists through visualization.",Propagating Visual Designs to Numerous Plots and Dashboards,,S&R,2021
"We present a pyramid-based scatterplot sampling technique to avoid overplotting and enable progressive and streaming
  visualization of large data. Our technique is based on a multiresolution pyramid-based decomposition of the underlying density map
  and makes use of the density values in the pyramid to guide the sampling at each scale for preserving the relative data densities
  and outliers. We show that our technique is competitive in quality with state-of-the-art methods and runs faster by about an order of
  magnitude. Also, we have adapted it to deliver progressive and streaming data visualization by processing the data in chunks and
  updating the scatterplot areas with visible changes in the density map. A quantitative evaluation shows that our approach generates
  stable and faithful progressive samples that are comparable to the state-of-the-art method in preserving relative densities and superior
  to it in keeping outliers and stability when switching frames. We present two case studies that demonstrate the effectiveness of our
  approach for exploring large data.",Pyramid-based Scatterplots Sampling for Progressive and Streaming Data Visualization,,DTr,2021
"We present a differentiable volume rendering solution that provides differentiability of all continuous parameters of the volume rendering process. This differentiable renderer is used to steer the parameters towards a setting with an optimal solution of a problem-specific objective function. We have tailored the approach to volume rendering by enforcing a constant memory footprint via analytic inversion of the blending functions. This makes it independent of the number of sampling steps through the volume and facilitates the consideration of small-scale changes. The approach forms the basis for automatic optimizations regarding external parameters of the rendering process and the volumetric density field itself. We demonstrate its use for automatic viewpoint selection using differentiable entropy as objective, and for optimizing a transfer function from rendered images of a given volume. Optimization of per-voxel densities is addressed in two different ways: First, we mimic inverse tomography and optimize a 3D density field from images using an absorption model. This simplification enables comparisons with algebraic reconstruction techniques and state-of-the-art differentiable path tracers. Second, we introduce a novel approach for tomographic reconstruction from images using an emission-absorption model with post-shading via an arbitrary transfer function.",Differentiable Direct Volume Rendering,,T&E,2021
"We propose Steadiness and Cohesiveness, two novel metrics to measure the inter-cluster reliability of multidimensional projection (MDP), specifically how well the inter-cluster structures are preserved between the original high-dimensional space and the low-dimensional projection space. Measuring inter-cluster reliability is crucial as it directly affects how well inter-cluster tasks (e.g., identifying cluster relationships in the original space from a projected view) can be conducted; however, despite the importance of inter-cluster tasks, we found that previous metrics, such as Trustworthiness and Continuity, fail to measure inter-cluster reliability. Our metrics consider two aspects of the inter-cluster reliability: Steadiness measures the extent to which clusters in the projected space form clusters in the original space, and Cohesiveness measures the opposite. They extract random clusters with arbitrary shapes and positions in one space and evaluate how much the clusters are stretched or dispersed in the other space. Furthermore, our metrics can quantify pointwise distortions, allowing for the visualization of inter-cluster reliability in a projection, which we call a reliability map. Through quantitative experiments, we verify that our metrics precisely capture the distortions that harm inter-cluster reliability while previous metrics have difficulty capturing the distortions. A case study also demonstrates that our metrics and the reliability map 1) support users in selecting the proper projection techniques or hyperparameters and 2) prevent misinterpretation while performing inter-cluster tasks, thus allow an adequate identification of inter-cluster structure.",Measuring and Explaining the Inter-Cluster Reliability of Multidimensional Projections,,DTr,2021
"Event sequence mining is often used to summarize patterns from hundreds of sequences but faces special challenges when handling racket sports data. In racket sports (e.g., tennis and badminton), a player hitting the ball is considered a multivariate event consisting of multiple attributes (e.g., hit technique and ball position). A rally (i.e., a series of consecutive hits beginning with one player serving the ball and ending with one player winning a point) thereby can be viewed as a multivariate event sequence. Mining frequent patterns and depicting how patterns change over time is instructive and meaningful to players who want to learn more short-term competitive strategies (i.e., tactics) that encompass multiple hits. However, players in racket sports usually change their tactics rapidly according to the opponent’s reaction, resulting in ever-changing tactic progression. In this work, we introduce a tailored visualization system built on a novel multivariate sequence pattern mining algorithm to facilitate explorative identification and analysis of various tactics and tactic progression. The algorithm can mine multiple non-overlapping multivariate patterns from hundreds of sequences effectively. Based on the mined results, we propose a glyph-based Sankey diagram to visualize the ever-changing tactic progression and support interactive data exploration. Through two case studies with four domain experts in tennis and badminton, we demonstrate that our system can effectively obtain insights about tactic progression in most racket sports. We further discuss the strengths and the limitations of our system based on domain experts’ feedback.",TacticFlow: Visual Analytics of Ever-Changing Tactics in Racket Sports,,A&D,2021
"Reviewing a think-aloud video is both time-consuming and demanding as it requires UX (user experience) professionals to attend to many behavioral signals of the user in the video. Moreover, challenges arise when multiple UX professionals need to collaborate to reduce bias and errors. We propose a collaborative visual analytics tool, CoUX, to facilitate UX evaluators collectively reviewing think-aloud usability test videos of digital interfaces. CoUX seamlessly supports usability problem identification, annotation, and discussion in an integrated environment. To ease the discovery of usability problems, CoUX visualizes a set of problem-indicators based on acoustic, textual, and visual features extracted from the video and audio of a think-aloud session with machine learning.CoUX further enables collaboration amongst UX evaluators for logging, commenting, and consolidating the discovered problems with a chatbox-like user interface. We designed CoUX based on a formative study with two UX experts and insights derived from the literature. We conducted a user study with six pairs of UX practitioners on collaborative think-aloud video analysis tasks. The results indicate that CoUX is useful and effective in facilitating both problem identification and collaborative teamwork. We provide insights into how different features of CoUX were used to support both independent analysis and collaboration. Furthermore, our work highlights opportunities to improve collaborative usability test video analysis.",CoUX: Collaborative Visual Analysis of Think-Aloud Usability Test Videos for Digital Interfaces,,App,2021
"The combination of diverse data types and analysis tasks in genomics has resulted in the development of a wide range of visualization techniques and tools.

Gosling balances expressiveness for comprehensive multi-scale genomics data visualizations with accessibility for domain scientists. Our accompanying JavaScript toolkit called Gosling.js provides scalable and interactive rendering. Gosling.js is built on top of an existing platform for web-based genomics data visualization to further simplify the visualization of common genomics data formats. We demonstrate the expressiveness of the grammar through a variety of real-world examples. Furthermore, we show how Gosling supports the design of novel genomics visualizations.

"Personal informatics research supports people in tracking personal data for the purposes of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge. This field, however, has predominantly focused on the data collection and insight-generation elements of self-tracking, with less attention paid to flexible data analysis. As a result, this inattention has lead to inflexible analytic pipelines that do not reflect or support the diverse ways people want to engage their data. This paper contributes a review of personal informatics and visualization research literature to expose a gap in our knowledge for designing flexible tools that assist people with engaging and analyzing personal data in personal contexts, which we call the personal informatics analysis gap. We explore this gap through a multi-stage longitudinal study on how asthmatics engage personal air quality data, and we report how participants: are motivated by broad and diverse goals; exhibited patterns in the way they explored their data; engaged with their data in playful ways; discovered new insights through serendipitous exploration; and were reluctant to use analysis tools on their own. These results present new opportunities for visual analysis research and suggest the need for fundamental shifts in how and what we design for supporting analysis of personal data.","Exploring the Personal Informatics Analysis Gap: ""There's a Lot of Bacon""",,T&E,2021
"The efficiency of warehouses is vital to e-commerce. Fast order processing at the warehouses ensures timely deliveries and improves customer satisfaction. However, monitoring, analyzing, and manipulating order processing in the warehouses in real time are challenging for traditional methods due to the sheer volume of incoming orders, the fuzzy definition of delayed order patterns, and the complex decision-making of order handling priorities. In this paper, we adopt a data-driven approach and propose OrderMonitor, a visual analytics system that assists warehouse managers in analyzing and improving order processing efficiency in real time based on streaming warehouse event data. Specifically, the order processing pipeline is visualized with a novel pipeline design based on the sedimentation metaphor to facilitate real-time order monitoring and suggest potentially abnormal orders. We also design a novel visualization that depicts order timelines based on the Gantt charts and Marey's graphs. Such a visualization helps the managers gain insights into the performance of order processing and find major blockers for delayed orders. Furthermore, an evaluating view is provided to assist users in inspecting order details and assigning priorities to improve the processing performance.

"Visualizing data in sports videos is gaining traction in sports analytics, given its ability to communicate insights and explicate player strategies engagingly. However, augmenting sports videos with such data visualizations is challenging, especially for sports analysts, as it requires considerable expertise in video editing. To ease the creation process, we present a design space that characterizes augmented sports videos at an element-level (what the constituents are) and clip-level (how those constituents are organized). We do so by systematically reviewing 233 examples of augmented sports videos collected from TV channels, teams, and leagues. The design space guides selection of data insights and visualizations for various purposes. Informed by the design space and close collaboration with domain experts, we design VisCommentator, a fast prototyping tool, to eases the creation of augmented table tennis videos by leveraging machine learning-based data extractors and design space-based visualization recommendations. With VisCommentator, sports analysts can create an augmented video by selecting the data to visualize instead of manually drawing the graphical marks. Our system can be generalized to other racket sports (e.g., tennis, badminton) once the underlying datasets and models are available. A user study with seven domain experts shows high satisfaction with our system, confirms that the participants can reproduce augmented sports videos in a short period, and provides insightful implications into future improvements and opportunities.",Augmenting Sports Videos with VisCommentator,,App,2021
"This paper presents a unified computational framework for the estimation of distances, geodesics and barycenters of merge trees. We extend recent work on the edit distance and introduce a new metric, called the Wasserstein distance between merge trees, which is purposely designed to enable efficient computations of geodesics and barycenters. Specifically, our new distance is strictly equivalent to the L 2 -Wasserstein distance between extremum persistence diagrams, but it is restricted to a smaller solution space, namely, the space of rooted partial isomorphisms between branch decomposition trees. This enables a simple extension of existing optimization frameworks for geodesics and barycenters from persistence diagrams to merge trees. We introduce a task-based algorithm which can be generically applied to distance, geodesic, barycenter or cluster computation. The task-based nature of our approach enables further accelerations with shared-memory parallelism. Extensive experiments on public ensembles and SciVis contest benchmarks demonstrate the efficiency of our approach – with barycenter computations in the orders of minutes for the largest examples – as well as its qualitative ability to generate representative barycenter merge trees, visually summarizing the features of interest found in the ensemble. We show the utility of our contributions with dedicated visualization applications: feature tracking, temporal reduction and ensemble clustering. We provide a lightweight C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.","Wasserstein Distances, Geodesics and Barycenters of Merge Trees",,DTr,2021
"People’s associations between colors and concepts influence their ability to interpret the meanings of colors in information visualizations. Previous work has suggested such effects are limited to concepts that have strong, specific associations with colors. However, although a concept may not be strongly associated with any colors, its mapping can be disambiguated in the context of other concepts in an encoding system. We articulate this view in Semantic Discriminability Theory, a general framework for understanding conditions determining when people can infer meaning from perceptual features. Semantic discriminability is the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts. Semantic Discriminability Theory posits that the capacity for semantic discriminability for a set of concepts is constrained by the difference between the feature-concept association distributions across the concepts in the set. We define formal properties of this theory, and test its implications in two experiments. The results show that the capacity to produce semantically discriminable colors for sets of concepts was indeed constrained by the statistical distance between color-concept association distributions (Experiment 1). Moreover, people could interpret meanings of colors in bar graphs insofar as the colors were semantically discriminable, even for concepts previously deemed “non-colorable” (Experiment 2). The results suggest that colors are more robust for visual communication than previously thought.",Context Matters: A Theory of Semantic Discriminability for Perceptual Encoding Systems,,T&E,2021
"Despite the ubiquity of communicative visualizations, specifying communicative intent during design is ad hoc. Whether we are selecting from a set of visualizations, commissioning someone to produce them, or creating them ourselves, an effective way of specifying intent can help guide this process. Ideally, we would have a concise and shared specification language. In previous work, we have argued that communicative intents can be viewed as a learning/assessment problem (i.e., what should the reader learn and what test should they do well on). Learning-based specification formats are linked (e.g., assessments are derived from objectives) but some may more effectively specify communicative intent. Through a large-scale experiment, we studied three specification types: learning objectives, insights, and assessments. Participants, guided by one of these specifications, rated their preferences for a set of visualization designs. Then, we evaluated the set of visualization designs to assess which specification led participants to prefer the most effective visualizations. We find that while all specification types have benefits over no-specification, each format has its own advantages. Our results show that learning objective-based specifications helped participants the most in visualization selection. We also identify situations in which specifications may be insufficient and assessments are vital.","Learning Objectives, Insights, and Assessments: How Specification Formats Impact Design",,T&E,2021
"Autonomous driving technologies often use state-of-the-art artificial intelligence algorithms to understand the relationship between the vehicle and the external environment, to predict the changes of the environment, and then to plan and control the behaviors of the vehicle accordingly. The complexity of such technologies makes it challenging to evaluate the performance of autonomous driving systems and to find ways to improve them. The current approaches to evaluating such autonomous driving systems largely use a single score to indicate the overall performance of a system, but domain experts have difficulties in understanding how individual components or algorithms in an autonomous driving system may contribute to the score. To address this problem, we collaborate with domain experts on autonomous driving algorithms, and propose a visual evaluation method for autonomous driving. Our method considers the data generated in all components during the whole process of autonomous driving, including perception results, planning routes, prediction of obstacles, various controlling parameters, and evaluation of comfort. We develop a visual analytics workflow to integrate an evaluation mathematical model with adjustable parameters, support the evaluation of the system from the level of the overall performance to the level of detailed measures of individual components, and to show both evaluation scores and their contributing factors. Our implemented visual analytics system provides an overview evaluation score at the beginning and shows the animation of the dynamic change of the scores at each period. Experts can interactively explore the specific component at different time periods and identify related factors. With our method, domain experts not only learn about the performance of an autonomous driving system, but also identify and access the problematic parts of each component. Our visual evaluation system can be applied to the autonomous driving simulation system and used for various evaluation cases. The results of using our system in some simulation cases and the feedback from involved domain experts confirm the usefulness and efficiency of our method in helping people gain in-depth insight into autonomous driving systems.",Visual Evaluation for Autonomous Driving,,App,2021

"Authors often transform a large screen visualization for smaller displays through rescaling, aggregation and other techniques when creating visualizations for both desktop and mobile devices (i.e., responsive visualization). However, transformations can alter relationships or patterns implied by the large screen view, requiring authors to reason carefully about what information to preserve while adjusting their design for the smaller display. We propose an automated approach to approximating the loss of support for task-oriented visualization insights (identification, comparison, and trend) in responsive transformation of a source visualization. We operationalize identification, comparison, and trend loss as objective functions calculated by comparing properties of the rendered source visualization to each realized target (small screen) visualization. To evaluate the utility of our approach, we train machine learning models on human ranked small screen alternative visualizations across a set of source visualizations. We find that our approach achieves an accuracy of 84% (random forest model) in ranking visualizations. We demonstrate this approach in a prototype responsive visualization recommender that enumerates responsive transformations using Answer Set Programming and evaluates the preservation of task-oriented insights using our loss measures. We discuss implications of our approach for the development of automated and semi-automated responsive visualization recommendation.",An Automated Approach to Reasoning About Task-Oriented Insights in Responsive Visualization,,T&E,2021
"Data can be visually represented using visual channels like position, length or luminance. An existing ranking of these visual channels is based on how accurately participants could report the ratio between two depicted values. There is an assumption that this ranking should hold for different tasks and for different numbers of marks. However, there is surprisingly little existing work that tests this assumption, especially given that visually computing ratios is relatively unimportant in real-world visualizations, compared to seeing, remembering, and comparing trends and motifs, across displays that almost universally depict more than two values. To simulate the information extracted from a glance at a visualization, we instead asked participants to immediately reproduce a set of values from memory after they were shown the visualization. These values could be shown in a bar graph (position (bar)), line graph (position (line)), heat map (luminance), bubble chart (area), misaligned bar graph (length), or ‘wind map’ (angle). 
  With a Bayesian multilevel modeling approach, we observed how the relevant rank positions of visual channels shift across different numbers of marks (2, 4 or 8) and for bias, precision, and error measures. The ranking did not hold, even for reproductions of only 2 marks, and the new ranking was highly inconsistent for reproductions of different numbers of marks. Other factors besides channel choice had an order of magnitude more influence on performance, such as the number of values in the series (e.g., more marks led to larger errors), or the value of each mark (e.g., small values were systematically overestimated). 
  Every visual channel was worse for displays with 8 marks than 4, consistent with established limits on visual memory.
  These results point to the need for a body of empirical studies that move beyond two-value ratio judgments as a baseline for ranking the quality of a visual channel, including testing new tasks (detection of trends or motifs), timescales (immediate computation, or later comparison), and the number of values (from a handful, to thousands).",Rethinking the Ranks of Visual Channels,,T&E,2021
"Persistence diagrams have been widely used to quantify the underlying features of filtered topological spaces in data visualization. In many applications, computing distances between diagrams is essential; however, computing these distances has been challenging due to the computational cost. In this paper, we propose a persistence diagram hashing framework that learns a binary code representation of persistence diagrams, which allows for fast computation of distances. This framework is built upon a generative adversarial network (GAN) with a diagram distance loss function to steer the learning process. Instead of using standard representations, we hash diagrams into binary codes, which have natural advantages in large-scale tasks. The training of this model is domain-oblivious in that it can be computed purely from synthetic, randomly created diagrams. As a consequence, our proposed method is directly applicable to various datasets without the need for retraining the model. These binary codes, when compared using fast Hamming distance, better maintain topological similarity properties between datasets than other vectorized representations. To evaluate this method, we apply our framework to the problem of diagram clustering and we compare the quality and performance of our approach to the state-of-the-art. In addition, we show the scalability of our approach on a dataset with 10k persistence diagrams, which is not possible with current techniques. Moreover, our experimental results demonstrate that our method is significantly faster with the potential of less memory usage, while retaining comparable or better quality comparisons.",A Domain-Oblivious Approach for Learning Concise Representations of Filtered Topological Spaces for Clustering,Topological data analysis;Persistence diagrams;Persistence diagram distances;Learned hashing;Clustering,DTr,2021
"Interactive visualization design and research have primarily focused on local data and synchronous events. However, for more complex use cases—e.g., remote database access and streaming data sources—developers must grapple with distributed data and asynchronous events. Currently, constructing these use cases is difficult and time-consuming; developers are forced to operationally program low-level details like asynchronous database querying and reactive event handling. This approach is in stark contrast to modern methods for browser-based interactive visualization, which feature high-level declarative specifications. In response, we present DIEL, a declarative framework that supports asynchronous events over distributed data. Like many declarative visualization languages, DIEL developers need only specify what data they want, rather than procedural steps for how to assemble it; uniquely, DIEL models asynchronous events (e.g., user interactions or server responses) as streams of data that are captured in event logs. To specify the state of a user interface at any time, developers author declarative queries over the data and event logs; DIEL compiles and optimizes a corresponding dataflow graph, and synthesizes necessary low-level distributed systems details. We demonstrate DIEL’s performance and expressivity through ex-ample interactive visualizations that make diverse use of remote data and coordination of asynchronous events. We further evaluate DIEL’s usability using the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework, revealing wins such as ease of change, and compromises such as premature commitments.",DIEL: Interactive Visualization Beyond the Here and Now,,S&R,2021
"For many households, investing for retirement is one of the most significant decisions and is fraught with uncertainty. In a classic study in behavioral economics, Benartzi and Thaler (1999) found evidence using bar charts that investors exhibit myopic loss aversion in retirement decisions: Investors overly focus on the potential for short-term losses, leading them to invest less in riskier assets and miss out on higher long-term returns. Recently, advances in uncertainty visualizations have shown improvements in decision-making under uncertainty in a variety of tasks. In this paper, we conduct a controlled and incentivized crowdsourced experiment replicating Benartzi and Thaler (1999) and extending it to measure the effect of different uncertainty representations on myopic loss aversion. Consistent with the original study, we find evidence of myopic loss aversion with bar charts and find that participants make better investment decisions with longer evaluation periods. We also find that common uncertainty representations such as interval plots and bar charts achieve the highest mean expected returns while other uncertainty visualizations lead to poorer long-term performance and strong effects on the equity premium. Qualitative feedback further suggests that different uncertainty representations lead to visual reasoning heuristics that can either mitigate or encourage a focus on potential short-term losses. We discuss implications of our results on using uncertainty visualizations for retirement decisions in practice and possible extensions for future work.",Effect of Uncertainty Visualizations on Myopic Loss Aversion and the Equity Premium Puzzle in Retirement Investment Decisions,,T&E,2021
"We present STNet, an end-to-end generative framework that synthesizes spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes with high fidelity for time-varying data. STNet includes two modules: a generator and a spatiotemporal discriminator. The input to the generator is two low-resolution volumes at both ends, and the output is the intermediate and the two-ending spatiotemporal super- resolution volumes. The spatiotemporal discriminator, leveraging convolutional long short-term memory, accepts a spatiotemporal super-resolution sequence as input and predicts a conditional score for each volume based on its spatial (the volume itself) and temporal (the previous volumes) information. We propose an unsupervised pre-training stage using cycle loss to improve the generalization of STNet. Once trained, STNet can generate spatiotemporal super-resolution volumes from low-resolution ones, offering scientists an option to save data storage (i.e., sparsely sampling the simulation output in both spatial and temporal dimensions). We compare STNet with the baseline bicubic+linear interpolation, two deep learning solutions (SSR+TSR, STD), and a state-of-the-art tensor compression solution (TTHRESH) to show the effectiveness of STNet.",STNet: An End-to-End Generative Framework for Synthesizing Spatiotemporal Super-Resolution Volumes,,DTr,2021
"Vision-based deep learning (DL) methods have achieved success in learning autonomous driving models from large scale crowd-sourced video datasets. They are trained to predict instantaneous driving behaviors from video data captured by on-vehicle cameras. In this paper, we develop a geo-context aware visualization system for the study of Autonomous Driving Model (ADM) predictions together with large scale ADM video data. The visual study is seamlessly integrated with the geographical environment by combining DL model performance with geospatial visualization techniques. Model performance measures can be studied together with a set of geo-spatial attributes over map views. Users can also discover and compare prediction behaviors of multiple DL models in both city-wide and street-level analysis, together with road images and video contents. Therefore, the system provides a new visual exploration platform for DL model designers in autonomous driving. Use cases and domain expert evaluation show the utility and effectiveness of the visualization system.",Geo-Context Aware Study of Vision-Based Autonomous Driving Models and Spatial Video Data,,A&D,2021
"This paper investigates how to make data comics interactive. Data comics are an effective and versatile means for visual communication, leveraging the power of sequential narration and combined textual and visual content, while providing an overview of the storyline through panels assembled in expressive layouts. While a powerful static storytelling medium that works well on paper support, adding interactivity to data comics can enable non-linear storytelling, personalization, levels of details, explanations, and potentially enriched user experiences. This paper introduces a set of operations tailored to support data comics narrative goals that go beyond the traditional linear, immutable storyline curated by a story author. The goals and operations include adding and removing panels into pre-defined layouts to support branching, change of perspective, or access to detail-on-demand, as well as providing and modifying data, and interacting with data representation, to support personalization and reader-defined data focus. We propose a lightweight specification language, COMICSCRIPT, for designers to add such interactivity to static comics. To assess the viability of our authoring process, we recruited six professional illustrators, designers and data comics enthusiasts and asked them to craft an interactive comic, allowing us to understand authoring workflow and potential of our approach. We present examples of interactive comics in a gallery. This initial step towards understanding the design space of interactive comics can inform the design of creation tools and experiences for interactive storytelling.",Interactive Data Comics,,R&I,2021
"Achieving high rendering quality in the visualization of large particle data, for example from large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, requires a significant amount of sub-pixel super-sampling, due to very high numbers of particles per pixel. Although it is impossible to super-sample all particles of large-scale data at interactive rates, efficient occlusion culling can decouple the overall data size from a high effective sampling rate of visible particles. However, while the latter is essential for domain scientists to be able to see important data features, performing occlusion culling by sampling or sorting the data is usually slow or error-prone due to visibility estimates of insufficient quality. We present a novel probabilistic culling architecture for super-sampled high-quality rendering of large particle data. Occlusion is dynamically determined at the sub-pixel level, without explicit visibility sorting or data simplification. We introduce confidence maps to probabilistically estimate confidence in the visibility data gathered so far. This enables progressive, confidence-based culling, helping to avoid wrong visibility decisions. In this way, we determine particle visibility with high accuracy, although only a small part of the data set is sampled. This enables extensive super-sampling of (partially) visible particles for high rendering quality, at a fraction of the cost of sampling all particles. For real-time performance with millions of particles, we exploit novel features of recent GPU architectures to group particles into two hierarchy levels, combining fine-grained culling with high frame rates.",Probabilistic Occlusion Culling using Confidence Maps for High-Quality Rendering of Large Particle Data,,S&R,2021
"Graphs are a ubiquitous data structure to model processes and relations in a wide range of domains. Examples include social networks, knowledge graphs, control-flow graphs in programs, and semantic scene graphs in images. Identifying subgraph patterns (or motifs) in graphs is one important approach to understand their structural properties. We propose a visual analytics system, GraphQ to support human-in-the-loop, example-based, subgraph pattern search in a database containing many individual graphs. Our approach goes beyond a predefined set of motifs and allows users to interactively specify the patterns of interest. To support fast, interactive queries, we use graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode the topological and node attributes in a graph as fixed-length
  latent vector representations, and perform subgraph matching in the latent space. However, due to the complexity of the problem, it is still difficult to obtain accurate one-to-one node correspondence in the matching results, which is crucial for visualization and
  interpretation. We, therefore, propose a novel GNN for node-alignment called NeuroAlign, to facilitate easy validation and interpretation of the query results. GraphQ provides a visual query interface with a query editor and a multi-scale visualization of the results, as well as a user feedback mechanism for refining the results with additional constraints. We demonstrate GraphQ through two example usage scenarios in different application domains: analyzing reusable subroutines in program workflows and semantic scene graph search in images. Quantitative experiments show that NeuroAlign achieves 19%–29% improvement in node-alignment accuracy compared to baseline GNN and provides up to 100x speedup compared to combinatorial algorithms. Our qualitative study with domain experts confirms the effectiveness of GraphQ for both usage scenarios.",Interactive Visual Pattern Search on Graph Data via Graph Representation Learning,,A&D,2021
"Well-designed data visualizations can lead to more powerful and intuitive processing by a viewer. To help a viewer intuitively compare values to quickly generate key takeaways, visualization designers can manipulate how data values are arranged in a chart to afford particular comparisons. Using simple bar charts as a case study, we empirically tested the comparison affordances of four common arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked. We asked participants to type out what patterns they perceived in a chart and we coded their takeaways into types of comparisons. In a second study, we asked data visualization design experts to predict which arrangement they would use to afford each type of comparison and found both alignments and mismatches with our findings. These results provide concrete guidelines for how both human designers and automatic chart recommendation systems can make visualizations that help viewers extract the ``right'' takeaway.",Visual Arrangements of Bar Charts Influence Comparisons in Viewer Takeaways,,T&E,2021
"State-of-the-art computation and visualization of vortices in unsteady fluid flow employ objective vortex criteria, which makes them independent of reference frames or observers. However, objectivity by itself, although crucial, is not sufficient to guarantee that one can identify physically-realizable observers that would perceive or detect the same vortices. Moreover, a significant challenge is that a single reference frame is often not sufficient to accurately observe multiple vortices that follow different motions. This paper presents a novel framework for the exploration and use of an interactively-chosen set of observers, of the resulting relative velocity fields, and of objective vortex structures. We show that our approach facilitates the objective detection and visualization of vortices relative to well-adapted reference frame motions, while at the same time guaranteeing that these observers are in fact physically realizable. In order to represent and manipulate observers efficiently, we make use of the low-dimensional vector space structure of the Lie algebra of physically-realizable observer motions. We illustrate that our framework facilitates the efficient choice and guided exploration of objective vortices in unsteady 2D flow, on planar as well as on spherical domains, using well-adapted reference frames.",Interactive Exploration of Physically-Observable Objective Vortices in Unsteady 2D Flow,,S&R,2021
"Natural language descriptions sometimes accompany visualizations to better communicate and contextualize their insights, and to improve their accessibility for readers with disabilities. However, it is difficult to evaluate the usefulness of these descriptions, and how effectively they improve access to meaningful information, because we have little understanding of the semantic content they convey, and how different readers receive this content. In response, we introduce a conceptual model for the semantic content conveyed by natural language descriptions of visualizations. Developed through a grounded theory analysis of 2,147 sentences, our model spans four levels of semantic content: enumerating visualization construction properties (e.g., marks and encodings); reporting statistical concepts and relations (e.g., extrema and correlations); identifying perceptual and cognitive phenomena (e.g., complex trends and patterns); and elucidating domain-specific insights (e.g., social and political context). To demonstrate how our model can be applied to evaluate the effectiveness of visualization descriptions, we conduct a mixed-methods evaluation with 30 blind and 90 sighted readers, and find that these reader groups differ significantly on which semantic content they rank as most useful. Together, our model and findings suggest that access to meaningful information is strongly reader-specific, and that research in automatic visualization captioning should orient toward descriptions that more richly communicate overall trends and statistics, sensitive to reader preferences. Our work further opens a space of research on natural language as a data interface coequal with visualization.",Accessible Visualization via Natural Language Descriptions: A Four-Level Model of Semantic Content,,T&E,2021
"Breaking news and first-hand reports often trend on social media platforms before traditional news outlets cover them. The real-time analysis of posts on such platforms can reveal valuable and timely insights for journalists, politicians, business analysts, and first responders, but the high number and diversity of new posts pose a challenge. In this work, we present an interactive system that enables the visual analysis of streaming social media data on a large scale in real-time. We propose an efficient and explainable dynamic clustering algorithm that powers a continuously updated visualization of the current thematic landscape as well as detailed visual summaries of specific topics of interest. Our parallel clustering strategy provides an adaptive stream with a digestible but diverse selection of recent posts related to relevant topics. We also integrate familiar visual metaphors that are highly interlinked for enabling both explorative and more focused monitoring tasks. Analysts can gradually increase the resolution to dive deeper into particular topics. In contrast to previous work, our system also works with non-geolocated posts and avoids extensive preprocessing such as detecting events. We evaluated our dynamic clustering algorithm and discuss several use cases that show the utility of our system.",Real-Time Visual Analysis of High-Volume Social Media Posts,,A&D,2021
"Visual query of spatiotemporal data is becoming an increasingly important function in visual analytics applications. Various works have been presented for querying large spatiotemporal data in real time. However, the real-time query of spatiotemporal data distribution is still an open challenge. As spatiotemporal data become larger, methods of aggregation, storage and querying become critical. We propose a new visual query system that creates a low-memory storage component and provides real-time visual interactions of spatiotemporal data. We first present a peak-based kernel density estimation method to produce the data distribution for the spatiotemporal data. Then a novel density dictionary learning approach is proposed to compress temporal density maps and accelerate the query calculation. Moreover, various intuitive query interactions are presented to interactively gain patterns. The experimental results obtained on three datasets demonstrate that the presented system offers an effective query for visual analytics of spatiotemporal data.",DDLVis: Real-time Visual Query of Spatiotemporal Data Distribution via Density Dictionary Learning,,DTr,2021
"Video moderation, which refers to remove deviant or explicit content from e-commerce livestreams, has become prevalent owing to social and engaging features. However, this task is tedious and time consuming due to the difficulties associated with watching and reviewing multimodal video content, including video frames and audio clips. To ensure effective video moderation, we propose VideoModerator, a risk-aware framework that seamlessly integrates human knowledge with machine insights. This framework incorporates a set of advanced machine learning models to extract the risk-aware features from multimodal video content and discover potentially deviant videos. Moreover, this framework introduces an interactive visualization interface with three views, namely, a video view, a frame view, and an audio view. In the video view, we adopt a segmented timeline and highlight high-risk periods that may contain deviant information. In the frame view, we present a novel visual summarization method that combines risk-aware features and video context to enable quick video navigation. In the audio view, we employ a storyline-based design to provide a multi-faceted overview which can be used to explore audio content. Furthermore, we report the usage of VideoModerator through a case scenario and conduct experiments and a controlled user study to validate its effectiveness.",VideoModerator: A Risk-aware Framework for Multimodal Video Moderation in E-Commerce,,A&D,2021
"In this design study, we present IRVINE, a Visual Analytics (VA) system, which facilitates the analysis of acoustic data to detect and understand previously unknown errors in the manufacturing of electrical engines. In serial manufacturing processes, signatures from acoustic data provide valuable information on how the relationship between multiple produced engines serves to detect and understand previously unknown errors. To analyze such signatures, IRVINE leverages interactive clustering and data labeling techniques, allowing users to analyze clusters of engines with similar signatures, drill down to groups of engines, and select an engine of interest. Furthermore, IRVINE allows to assign labels to engines and clusters and annotate the cause of an error in the acoustic raw measurement of an engine. Since labels and annotations represent valuable knowledge, they are conserved in a knowledge database to be available for other stakeholders. We contribute a design study, where we developed IRVINE in four main iterations with engineers from a company in the automotive sector. To validate IRVINE, we conducted a field study with six domain experts. Our results suggest a high usability and usefulness of IRVINE as part of the improvement of a real-world manufacturing process. Specifically, with IRVINE domain experts were able to label and annotate produced electrical engines more than 30% faster.",IRVINE: A Design Study on Analyzing Correlation Patterns of Electrical Engines,,App,2021
"Data stories often seek to elicit affective feelings from viewers. However, how to design affective data stories remains under-explored. In this work, we investigate one specific design factor, animation, and present Kineticharts, an animation design scheme for creating charts that express five positive affects: joy, amusement, surprise, tenderness, and excitement. These five affects were found to be frequently communicated through animation in data stories. Regarding each affect, we designed varied kinetic motions represented by bar charts, line charts, and pie charts, resulting in 60 animated charts for the five affects. We designed Kineticharts by first conducting a need-finding study with professional practitioners from data journalism and then analyzing a corpus of affective motion graphics to identify salient kinetic patterns. We evaluated Kineticharts through two user studies. The results suggest that Kineticharts can accurately convey affects, and improve the expressiveness of data stories, as well as enhance user engagement without hindering data comprehension compared to the animation design from DataClips, an authoring tool for data videos.",Kineticharts: Augmenting Affective Expressiveness of Charts in Data Stories with Animation Design,,R&I,2021
"Probabilistic networks are challenging to visualize using the traditional node-link diagram. Encoding edge probability using visual variables like width or fuzziness makes it difﬁcult for users of static network visualizations to estimate network statistics like densities, isolates, path lengths, or clustering under uncertainty. We introduce Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs), a visualization technique that animates a sequence of network realizations sampled from a network distribution deﬁned by probabilistic edges. NetHOPs employ an aggregation and anchoring algorithm used in dynamic and longitudinal graph drawing to parameterize layout stability to support uncertainty estimation. We present a community matching algorithm we developed to enable visualizing the uncertainty of cluster membership and community occurrence. We describe the results of a study in which 51 network experts used NetHOPs to complete a set of common visual analysis tasks and reported how they perceived network structures and properties subject to uncertainty. Participants’ estimates fell, on average, within 11% of the ground truth statistics, suggesting NetHOPs can be a reasonable approach for enabling network analysts to reason about multiple properties under uncertainty. Participants appeared able to articulate the distribution of network statistics slightly more accurately when they could manipulate the layout anchoring and the animation speed. Based on these ﬁndings, we synthesize design recommendations for developing and using animated network visualizations for probabilistic networks.",Visualizing Uncertainty in Probabilistic Graphs with Network Hypothetical Outcome Plots (NetHOPs),,R&I,2021
"For all its potential in supporting data analysis, particularly in exploratory situations, visualization also creates barriers: accessibility for blind and visually impaired individuals. Regardless of how effective a visualization is, providing equal access for blind users requires a paradigm shift for the visualization research community. To enact such a shift, it is not sufficient to treat visualization accessibility as merely another technical problem to overcome. Instead, supporting the millions of blind and visually impaired users around the world who have equally valid needs for data analysis as sighted individuals requires a respectful, equitable, and holistic approach that includes all users from the onset. In this paper, we draw on accessibility research methodologies to make inroads towards such an approach. We first identify the people who have specific insight into how blind people perceive the world: orientation and mobility (O&M) experts, who are instructors that teach blind individuals how to navigate the physical world using non-visual senses. We interview 10 O&M experts—all of them blind—to understand how best to use sensory substitution other than the visual sense for conveying spatial layouts. Finally, we investigate our qualitative findings using thematic analysis. While blind people in general tend to use both sound and touch to understand their surroundings, we focused on auditory affordances and how they can be used to make data visualizations accessible—using sonification and auralization. However, our experts recommended supporting a combination of senses—sound and touch—to make charts accessible as blind individuals may be more familiar with exploring tactile charts. We report results on both sound and touch affordances, and conclude by discussing implications for accessible visualization for blind individuals.",Towards Understanding Sensory Substitution for Accessible Visualization: An Interview Study,,T&E,2021
"It has been widely suggested that a key goal of visualization systems is to assist decision making, but is this true? We conduct a critical investigation on whether the activity of decision making is indeed central to the visualization domain. By approaching decision making as a user task, we explore the degree to which decision tasks are evident in visualization research and user studies. Our analysis suggests that decision tasks are not commonly found in current visualization task taxonomies and that the visualization field has yet to leverage guidance from decision theory domains on how to study such tasks. We further found that the majority of visualizations addressing decision making were not evaluated based on their ability to assist decision tasks. Finally, to help expand the impact of visual analytics in organizational as well as casual decision making activities, we initiate a research agenda on how decision making assistance could be elevated throughout visualization research.",A Critical Reflection on Visualization Research: Where Do Decision Making Tasks Hide?,,T&E,2021
"We contribute a deep-learning-based method that assists in designing analytical dashboards for analyzing a data table.
  Given a data table, data workers usually need to experience a tedious and time-consuming process to select meaningful combinations of data columns for creating charts. This process is further complicated by the needs of creating dashboards composed of multiple views that unveil different perspectives of data. Existing automated approaches for recommending multiple-view visualizations mainly build on manually crafted design rules, producing sub-optimal or irrelevant suggestions. To address this gap, we present a deep learning approach for selecting data columns and recommending multiple charts. More importantly, we integrate the deep learning models into a mixed-initiative system. Our model could make recommendations given optional user-input selections of data columns. The model, in turn, learns from provenance data of authoring logs in an offline manner. We compare our deep learning model with existing methods for visualization recommendation and conduct a user study to evaluate the usefulness of the system.",MultiVision: Designing Analytical Dashboards with Deep Learning Based Recommendation,,DTr,2021
"Embeddings of high-dimensional data are widely used to explore data, to verify analysis results, and to communicate information. Their explanation, in particular with respect to the input attributes, is often difficult. With linear projects like PCA the axes can still be annotated meaningfully. With non-linear projections this is no longer possible and alternative strategies such as attribute-based color coding are required. In this paper, we review existing augmentation techniques and discuss their limitations. We present the Non-Linear Embeddings Surveyor (NoLiES) that combines a novel augmentation strategy for projected data (rangesets) with interactive analysis in a small multiples setting. Rangesets use a set-based visualization approach for binned attribute values that enable the user to quickly observe structure and detect outliers. We detail the link between algebraic topology and rangesets and demonstrate the utility of NoLiES in case studies with various challenges (complex attribute value distribution, many attributes, many data points) and a real-world application to understand latent features of matrix completion in thermodynamics.",Attribute-based Explanation of Non-Linear Embeddings of High-Dimensional Data,,DTr,2021
"Inspection of tissues using a light microscope is the primary method of diagnosing many diseases, notably cancer. Highly multiplexed tissue imaging builds on this foundation, enabling collection of up to 60 channels of molecular information plus cell and tissue morphology using antibody staining. This provides unique insight into disease biology and promises to help with design of patient-specific therapies. However, a substantial gap remains with respect to visualizing the resulting multivariate image data and effectively supporting pathology workflows in digital environments on screen. We, therefore, developed Scope2Screen, a scalable software system for focus+context exploration and annotation of whole-slide, high-plex, tissue images. Our approach scales to analyzing 100GB images of 10^9 or more pixels per channel, containing millions of individual cells. A multidisciplinary team of visualization experts, microscopists, and pathologists identified key image exploration and annotation tasks involving finding, magnifying, quantifying, and organizing regions of interest (ROIs) in an intuitive and cohesive manner. Building on a scope-to-screen metaphor, we present interactive lensing techniques that operate at single-cell and tissue levels. Lenses are equipped with task-specific functionality and descriptive statistics, making it possible to analyze image features, cell types, and spatial arrangements (neighborhoods) across image channels and scales. A fast sliding-window search guides users to regions similar to those under the lens; these regions can be analyzed and considered either separately or as part of a larger image collection. A novel snapshot method enables linked lens configurations and image statistics to be saved, restored, and shared with these regions. We validate our designs with domain experts and apply Scope2Screen in two case studies involving lung and colorectal cancers to discover cancer-relevant image features.",Scope2Screen: Focus+Context Techniques for Pathology Tumor Assessment in Multivariate Image Data,,R&I,2021
"There are a few prominent practices for conducting reviews of academic literature, including searching for specific keywords on Google Scholar or checking citations from some initial seed paper(s). These approaches serve a critical purpose for academic literature reviews, yet there remain challenges in identifying relevant literature when similar work may utilize different terminology (e.g., mixed-initiative visual analytics papers may not use the same terminology as papers on model-steering, yet the two topics are relevant to one another). In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.",VitaLITy: Promoting Serendipitous Discovery of Academic Literature with Transformers & Visual Analytics,,App,2021
"We present Joint t-Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (Joint t-SNE), a technique to generate comparable projections of multiple high-dimensional datasets. Although t-SNE has been widely employed to visualize high-dimensional datasets from various domains, it is limited to projecting a single dataset. When a series of high-dimensional datasets, such as datasets changing over time, is projected independently using t-SNE, misaligned layouts are obtained. Even items with identical features across datasets are projected to different locations, making the technique unsuitable for comparison tasks. To tackle this problem, we introduce edge similarity, which captures the similarities between two adjacent time frames based on the Graphlet Frequency Distribution (GFD). We then integrate a novel loss term into the t-SNE loss function, which we call vector constraints, to preserve the vectors between projected points across the projections, allowing these points to serve as visual landmarks for direct comparisons between projections. Using synthetic datasets whose ground-truth structures are known, we show that Joint t-SNE outperforms existing techniques, including Dynamic t-SNE, in terms of local coherence error, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and neighborhood preservation. We also showcase a real-world use case to visualize and compare the activation of different layers of a neural network.",Joint t-SNE for Comparable Projections of Multiple High-Dimensional Datasets,,DTr,2021
"Although we have seen a proliferation of algorithms for recommending visualizations, these algorithms are rarely compared with one another, making it difficult to ascertain which algorithm is best for a given visual analysis scenario. Though several formal frameworks have been proposed in response, we believe this issue persists because visualization recommendation algorithms are inadequately specified from an evaluation perspective. In this paper, we propose an evaluation-focused framework to contextualize and compare a broad range of visualization recommendation algorithms. We present the structure of our framework, where algorithms are specified using three components: (1) a graph representing the full space of possible visualization designs, (2) the method used to traverse the graph for potential candidates for recommendation, and (3) an oracle used to rank candidate designs. To demonstrate how our framework guides the formal comparison of algorithmic performance, we not only theoretically compare five existing representative recommendation algorithms, but also empirically compare four new algorithms generated based on our findings from the theoretical comparison. Our results show that these algorithms behave similarly in terms of user performance, highlighting the need for more rigorous formal comparisons of recommendation algorithms to further clarify their benefits in various analysis scenarios.",An Evaluation-Focused Framework for Visualization Recommendation Algorithms,,T&E,2021
"We explore how the lens of fictional superpowers can help characterize how visualizations empower people and provide inspiration for new visualization systems. Researchers and practitioners often tout visualizations’ ability to “make the invisible visible”and to “enhance cognitive abilities.” Meanwhile superhero comics and other modern fiction often depict characters with similarly fantastic abilities that allow them to see and interpret the world in ways that transcend traditional human perception. We investigate the intersection of these domains, and show how the language of superpowers can be used to characterize existing visualization systems and suggest opportunities for new and empowering ones. We introduce two frameworks: The first characterizes seven underlying mechanics that form the basis for a variety of visual superpowers portrayed in fiction. The second identifies seven ways in which visualization tools and interfaces can instill a sense of empowerment in the people who use them. Building on these observations, we illustrate a diverse set of “visualization superpowers” and highlight opportunities for the visualization community to create new system sand interactions that empower new experiences with data",Perception!

"Data stories integrate compelling visual content to communicate data insights in the form of narratives. The narrative structure of a data story serves as the backbone that determines its expressiveness, and it can largely influence how audiences perceive the insights. Freytag's Pyramid is a classic narrative structure that has been widely used in film and literature. While there are continuous recommendations and discussions about applying Freytag's Pyramid to data stories, there is little systematic and practical guidance for data story creators on how to use Freytag's Pyramid for structured data story creation. To bridge this gap, we examined how existing practices apply Freytag's Pyramid through analyzing stories extracted from 103 data videos. Based on our findings, we propose a design space of narrative patterns, data flows, and visual communications to provide practical guidance on achieving narrative intents, organizing data facts, and selecting visual design techniques through the story creation process. We evaluated the proposed design space through a workshop with 25 participants. The results show that our design space provides a clear framework for rapid storyboarding of data stories with Freytag's Pyramid.",A Design Space for Applying the Freytag's Pyramid Structure to Data Stories,,R&I,2021
"Multiple-view visualization (MV) has been heavily used in visual analysis tools for sensemaking of data in various domains (e.g., bioinformatics, cybersecurity and text analytics). One common task of visual analysis with multiple views is to relate data across different views. For example, to identify threats, an intelligence analyst needs to link people from a social network graph with locations on a crime-map, and then search and read relevant documents. Currently, exploring cross-view data relationships heavily relies on view-coordination techniques (e.g., brushing and linking). They may require significant user effort on many trial-and-error attempts, such as repetitiously selecting elements in one view, observing and following elements highlighted in other views. To address this, we present SightBi, a visual analytics approach for supporting cross-view data relationship explorations. We discuss the design rationale of SightBi in detail, with identified user tasks regarding the usage of cross-view data relationships. SightBi formalize cross-view data relationships as biclusters and compute them from a dataset. SightBi uses a bi-context design that highlights creating stand-alone relationship-views. This helps to preserve existing views and serves as an overview of cross-view data relationships to guide user explorations. Moreover, SightBi allows users to interactively manage the layout of multiple views by using newly created relationship-views. With a usage scenario, we demonstrate the usefulness of SightBi for sensemaking of cross-view data relationships.",SightBi: Exploring Cross-View Data Relationships with Biclusters,,R&I,2021
"Problem-driven visualization work is rooted in deeply understanding the data, actors, processes, and workflows of a target domain. However, an individual's personality traits and cognitive abilities may also influence visualization use. Diverse user needs and abilities raise natural questions for specificity in visualization design: Could individuals from different domains exhibit performance differences when using visualizations? Are any systematic variations related to their cognitive abilities? This study bridges domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those provided by cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task performance across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these differences to variations in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks related to pie charts, isocontour plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented spatial ability test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex visualizations (isocontour plots and scatterplots), but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We found that correctness correlates with spatial ability, and the professions differ in terms of spatial ability. These results indicate that domains differ not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in terms of how effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their cognitive traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments suggests that focusing on performance neglects important nuances, such as differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations and potential skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on discipline-specific visualization with specific recommendations to help guide visualization design that celebrates the uniqueness of the disciplines and individuals we seek to serve.",Professional Differences: A Comparative Study of Visualization Task Performance and Spatial Ability Across Disciplines,,App,2021
"We present Knowledge Rocks, an implementation strategy and guideline for augmenting visualization systems to knowledge-assisted visualization systems, as defined by the KAVA model. Visualization systems become more and more sophisticated. Hence, it is increasingly important to support users with an integrated knowledge base in making constructive choices and drawing the right conclusions. We support the effective reactivation of visualization software resources by augmenting them with knowledge-assistance. To provide a general and yet supportive implementation strategy, we propose an implementation process that bases on an application-agnostic architecture. This architecture is derived from existing knowledge-assisted visualization systems and the KAVA model. Its centerpiece is an ontology that is able to automatically analyze and classify input data, linked to a database to store classified instances. We discuss design decisions and advantages of the KR framework and illustrate its broad area of application in diverse integration possibilities of this architecture into an existing visualization system. In addition, we provide a detailed case study by augmenting an it-security system with knowledge-assistance facilities.",Knowledge Rocks: Adding Knowledge Assistance to Visualization Systems,,A&D,2021
"Visual data analysis tools provide people with the agency and flexibility to explore data using a variety of interactive functionality. However, this flexibility may introduce potential consequences in situations where users unknowingly overemphasize or underemphasize specific subsets of the data or attribute space they are analyzing. For example, users may overemphasize specific attributes and/or their values (e.g., Gender is always encoded on the X axis), underemphasize others (e.g., Religion is never encoded), ignore a subset of the data (e.g., older people are filtered out), etc. In response, we present Lumos, a visual data analysis tool that captures and shows the interaction history with data to increase awareness of such analytic behaviors. Using in-situ (at the place of interaction) and ex-situ (in an external view) visualization techniques, Lumos provides real-time feedback to users for them to reflect on their activities. For example, Lumos highlights datapoints that have been previously examined in the same visualization (in-situ) and also overlays them on the underlying data distribution (i.e., baseline distribution) in a separate visualization (ex-situ). Through a user study with 24 participants, we investigate how Lumos helps users' data exploration and decision-making processes. We found that Lumos increases users' awareness of visual data analysis practices in real-time, promoting reflection upon and acknowledgement of their intentions and potentially influencing subsequent interactions.",Lumos: Increasing Awareness of Analytic Behavior during Visual Data Analysis,,A&D,2021
"Circular glyphs are widely used in different fields because of their effectiveness in representing multidimensional data. However, the creation of circular glyphs remains a difficult task due to the demand for professional design skills and laborious design processes. This paper presents an interactive authoring tool called GlyphCreator to support the example-based generation of circular glyphs. Given an example circular glyph and multidimensional input data, GlyphCreator can promptly generate a list of design candidates and supports interactive editing on the candidates to satisfy different design requirements. To develop GlyphCreator, we first derive a design space of circular glyphs from summarizing the relation between different visual elements. With this design space, we build a circular glyph dataset and develop a deep learning model for glyph parsing. The model is able to deconstruct a circular glyph bitmap into a series of visual elements. Next, we propose an interface with effective interactions to help users bind the input data attributes to visual elements and customize visual styles. We evaluate the parsing model through a quantitative experiment and demonstrate the use of GlyphCreator through a usage scenario. The effectiveness of GlyphCreator is confirmed through user interviews.",GlyphCreator: Towards Example-Based Automatic Generation of Circular Glyphs,,R&I,2021
"Infographic bar charts have been widely adopted for communicating numerical information because of their attractiveness and memorability. However, these infographics are often created manually with general tools, such as PowerPoint and Adobe Illustrator, and merely composed of primitive visual elements, such as text blocks and shapes. With the absence of chart models, updating or reusing these infographics requires tedious and error-prone manual edits. In this paper, we propose a mixed-initiative approach to mitigate this pain point. On one hand, machines are adopted to perform precise and trivial operations, such as mapping numerical values to shape attributes and aligning shapes. On the other hand, we rely on humans to perform subjective and creative tasks, such as changing embellishments or approving the edits made by machines. We encapsulate our technique in a PowerPoint add-in prototype and demonstrate the effectiveness by applying our technique on a diverse set of infographic bar chart examples.",A Mixed-Initiative Approach to Reusing Infographic Charts,,R&I,2021
"Visualization recommendation or automatic visualization generation can significantly lower the barriers for general users to rapidly create effective data visualizations, especially for those users without a background in data visualizations. However, existing rule-based approaches require tedious manual specifications of visualization rules by visualization experts. Other machine learning-based approaches often work like black-box and are difficult to understand why a specific visualization is recommended, limiting the wider adoption of these approaches. This paper fills the gap by presenting KG4Vis, a knowledge graph (KG)-based approach for visualization recommendation. It does not require manual specifications of visualization rules and can also guarantee good explainability. Specifically, we propose a framework for building knowledge graphs, consisting of three types of entities (i.e., data features, data columns and visualization design choices) and the relations between them, to model the mapping rules between data and effective visualizations. A TransE-based embedding technique is employed to learn the embeddings of both entities and relations of the knowledge graph from existing dataset-visualization pairs. Such embeddings intrinsically model the desirable visualization rules. Then, given a new dataset, effective visualizations can be inferred from the knowledge graph with semantically meaningful rules. We conducted extensive evaluations to assess the proposed approach, including quantitative comparisons, case studies and expert interviews. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",KG4Vis: A Knowledge Graph-Based Approach for Visualization Recommendation,,DTr,2021
"Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e., errors that occur due to the use of mental “shortcuts”). In this work, we explore how visualizing a user’s interaction history (i.e., which data points a user has interacted with) can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection of one’s analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed interaction history in real-time while exploring data (e.g., by coloring points in the scatterplot that the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (e.g., by comparing the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted a series of in-lab experiments and a crowdsourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where e.g. gender bias or political party bias may drive one’s analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.","Left, Right, and Gender: Exploring Interaction Traces to Mitigate Human Biases",,T&E,2021
"Significant work has been done towards deep learning (DL) models for automatic lung and lesion segmentation and classification of COVID-19 on chest CT data. However, comprehensive visualization systems focused on supporting the dual visual+DL diagnosis of COVID-19 are non-existent. We present COVID-view, a visualization application specially tailored for radiologists to diagnose COVID-19 from chest CT data. The system incorporates a complete pipeline of automatic lungs segmentation, localization/isolation of lung abnormalities, followed by visualization, visual and DL analysis, and measurement/quantification tools. Our system combines the traditional 2D workflow of radiologists with newer 2D and 3D visualization techniques with DL support for a more comprehensive diagnosis. COVID-view incorporates a novel DL model for classifying the patients into positive/negative COVID-19 cases, which acts as a reading aid for the radiologist using COVID-view, and provides the attention heatmap as an explainable DL for the model output. We designed and evaluated COVID-view through suggestions, close feedback and conducting case studies of real-world patient data by expert radiologists who have substantial experience diagnosing chest CT scans for COVID-19, pulmonary embolism, and other forms of lung infections. We present requirements and task analysis for the diagnosis of COVID-19 that motivate our design choices and results in a practical system which is capable of handling real-world patient cases.",COVID-view: Diagnosis of COVID-19 using Chest CT,,App,2021
"Analysts often make visual causal inferences about possible data-generating models. However, visual analytics (VA) software tends to leave these models implicit in the mind of the analyst, which casts doubt on the statistical validity of informal visual ""insights"". We formally evaluate the quality of causal inferences from visualizations by adopting causal support---a Bayesian cognition model that learns the probability of alternative causal explanations given some data---as a normative benchmark for causal inferences. We contribute two experiments assessing how well crowdworkers can detect (1) a treatment effect and (2) a confounding relationship. We find that chart users’ causal inferences tend to be insensitive to sample size such that they deviate from our normative benchmark. While interactively cross-filtering data in visualizations can improve sensitivity, on average users do not perform reliably better with common visualizations than they do with textual contingency tables. These experiments demonstrate the utility of causal support as an evaluation framework for inferences in VA and point to opportunities to make analysts' mental models more explicit in VA software.",Causal Support: Modeling Causal Inferences with Visualizations,,T&E,2021
"As uncertainty visualizations for general audiences become increasingly common, designers must understand the full impact of uncertainty communication techniques on viewers' decision processes. Prior work demonstrates mixed performance outcomes with respect to how individuals make decisions using various visual and textual depictions of uncertainty. Part of the inconsistency across findings may be due to an over-reliance on task accuracy, which cannot, on its own, provide a comprehensive understanding of how uncertainty visualization techniques support reasoning processes. In this work, we advance the debate surrounding the efficacy of modern 1D uncertainty visualizations by conducting converging quantitative and qualitative analyses of both the effort and strategies used by individuals when provided with quantile dotplots, density plots, interval plots, mean plots, and textual descriptions of uncertainty. We utilize two approaches for examining effort across uncertainty communication techniques: a measure of individual differences in working-memory capacity known as an operation span (OSPAN) task and self-reports of perceived workload via the NASA-TLX. The results reveal that both visualization methods and working-memory capacity impact participants' decisions. Specifically, quantile dotplots and density plots (i.e., distributional annotations) result in more accurate judgments than interval plots, textual descriptions of uncertainty, and mean plots (i.e., summary annotations). Additionally, participants' open-ended responses suggest that individuals viewing distributional annotations are more likely to employ a strategy that explicitly incorporates uncertainty into their judgments than those viewing summary annotations. When comparing quantile dotplots to density plots, this work finds that both methods are equally effective for low-working-memory individuals. However, for individuals with high-working-memory capacity, quantile dotplots evoke more accurate responses with less perceived effort. Given these results, we advocate for the inclusion of converging behavioral and subjective workload metrics in addition to accuracy performance to further disambiguate meaningful differences among visualization techniques.",Examining Effort in 1D Uncertainty Communication Using Individual Differences in Working Memory and NASA-TLX,,T&E,2021
"Complex, high-dimensional data is used in a wide range of domains to explore problems and make decisions. Analysis of high-dimensional data, however, is vulnerable to the hidden influence of confounding variables, especially as users apply ad hoc filtering operations to visualize only specific subsets of an entire dataset. Thus, visual data-driven analysis can mislead users and encourage mistaken assumptions about causality or the strength of relationships between features. This work introduces a novel visual approach designed to reveal the presence of confounding variables via counterfactual possibilities during visual data analysis. It is implemented in CoFact, an interactive visualization prototype that determines and visualizes counterfactual subsets to better support user exploration of feature relationships. Using publicly available datasets, we conducted a controlled user study to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach; the results indicate that users exposed to counterfactual visualizations formed more careful judgments about feature-to-outcome relationships.",Improving Visualization Interpretation Using Counterfactuals,,R&I,2021
"Administrative justice concerns the relationships between individuals and the state. It includes redress and complaints on decisions of a child’s education, social care, licensing, planning, environment, housing and homelessness. However, if someone has a complaint or an issue, it is challenging for people to understand different possible redress paths and explore what path is suitable for their situation. Explanatory visualisation has the potential to display these paths of redress in a clear way, such that people can see, understand and explore their options. The visualisation challenge is further complicated because information is spread across many documents, laws, guidance and policies and requires judicial interpretation. Consequently, there is not a single database of paths of redress. In this work we present how we have co-designed a system to visualise administrative justice paths of redress. Simultaneously, we classify, collate and organise the underpinning data, from expert workshops, heuristic evaluation and expert critical reflection. We make four contributions: (i) an application design study of the explanatory visualisation tool (Artemus), (ii) coordinated and co-design approach to aggregating the data, (iii) two in-depth case studies in housing and education demonstrating explanatory paths of redress in administrative law, and (iv) reflections on the expert co-design process and expert data gathering and explanatory visualisation for administrative justice and law.",Explanatory Journeys: Visualising to Understand and Explain Administrative Justice Paths of Redress,,App,2021
"Finding the similarities and differences between two or more groups of datasets is a fundamental analysis task. For high-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) methods are often used to find the characteristics of each group. However, existing DR methods provide limited capability and flexibility for such comparative analysis as each method is designed only for a narrow analysis target, such as identifying factors that most differentiate groups. In this work, we introduce an interactive DR framework where we integrate our new DR method, called ULCA (unified linear comparative analysis), with an interactive visual interface. ULCA unifies two DR schemes, discriminant analysis and contrastive learning, to support various comparative analysis tasks. To provide flexibility for comparative analysis, we develop an optimization algorithm that enables analysts to interactively refine ULCA results. Additionally, we provide an interactive visualization interface to examine ULCA results with a rich set of analysis libraries. We evaluate ULCA and the optimization algorithm to show their efficiency as well as present multiple case studies using real-world datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework.",Interactive Dimensionality Reduction for Comparative Analysis,,A&D,2021
"Earth scientists are increasingly employing time series data with multiple dimensions and high temporal resolution to study the impacts of climate and environmental changes on Earth’s atmosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere, and lithosphere. However, the large number of variables and varying time scales of antecedent conditions contributing to natural phenomena hinder scientists from completing more than the most basic analyses. In this paper, we present EVis (Environmental Visualization), a new visual analytics prototype to help scientists analyze and explore recurring environmental events (e.g. rock fracture, landslides, heat waves, floods) and their relationships with high dimensional time series of continuous numeric environmental variables, such as ambient temperature and precipitation. EVis provides coordinated scatterplots, heatmaps, histograms, and RadViz for foundational analyses. These features allow users to interactively examine relationships between events and one, two, three, or more environmental variables. EVis also provides a novel visual analytics approach to allowing users to discover temporally lagging relationships related to antecedent conditions between events and multiple variables, a critical task in Earth sciences. In particular, this latter approach projects multivariate time series onto trajectories in a 2D space using RadViz, and clusters the trajectories for temporal pattern discovery. Our case studies with rock cracking data and interviews with domain experts from a range of sub-disciplines within Earth sciences illustrate the extensive applicability and usefulness of EVis.",EVis: Visually Analyzing Environmentally Driven Events,,App,2021

The results confirm that our topology-based approach captures known patterns, distinctions between emotions, and distinctions between individuals, which is an important step towards more robust and explainable emotion recognition by machines.",AffectiveTDA: Using Topological Data Analysis to Improve Analysis and Explainability in Affective Computing,,App,2021
"Edge bundling techniques cluster edges with similar attributes (i.e. similarity in direction and proximity) together to reduce the visual clutter. All edge bundling techniques to date implicitly or explicitly cluster groups of individual edges, or parts of them, together based on these attributes. These clusters can result in ambiguous connections that do not exist in the data. Confluent drawings of networks do not have these ambiguities, but require the layout to be computed as part of the bundling process. We devise a new bundling method, edge-path bundling, to simplify edge clutter while greatly reducing ambiguities compared to previous bundling techniques. Edge-path bundling takes a layout as input and clusters each edge along a weighted, shortest path to limit its deviation from a straight line. Edge-path bundling does not incur independent edge ambiguities typically seen in all edge bundling methods, and the level of bundling can be tuned through shortest path distances, Euclidean distances, and combinations of the two. Also, directed edge bundling naturally emerges from the model. Through metric evaluations, we demonstrate the advantages of edge-path bundling over other techniques.",Edge-Path Bundling: A Less Ambiguous Edge Bundling Approach,,S&R,2021
"Professional roles for data visualization designers are growing in popularity, and interest in relationships between the academic research and professional practice communities is gaining traction. However, despite the potential for knowledge sharing between these communities, we have little understanding of the ways in which practitioners design in real-world, professional settings. Inquiry in numerous design disciplines indicates that practitioners approach complex situations in ways that are fundamentally different from those of researchers. In this work, I take a practice-led approach to understanding design practice on its own terms. Twenty data visualization practitioners were interviewed and asked about their design process, including the steps they take, how they make decisions, and the methods they use. Findings suggest that practitioners do not follow highly systematic processes, but instead rely on situated forms of knowing and acting in which they draw from precedent and use methods and principles that are determined appropriate in the moment. These findings have implications for how visualization researchers understand and engage with practitioners, and how educators approach the training of future data visualization designers.",Understanding Data Visualization Design Practice,,T&E,2021
"A growing number of longitudinal cohort studies are generating data with extensive patient observations across multiple timepoints. Such data offers promising opportunities to better understand the progression of diseases. However, these observations are usually treated as general events in existing visual analysis tools. As a result, their capabilities in modeling disease progression are not fully utilized. To fill this gap, we designed and implemented ThreadStates, an interactive visual analytics tool for the exploration of longitudinal patient cohort data. The focus of ThreadStatesis to identify the states of disease progression by learning from observation data in a human-in-the-loop manner. We propose a novel Glyph Matrix design and combine it with a scatter plot to enable seamless identification, observation, and refinement of states. The disease progression patterns are then revealed in terms of state transitions using Sankey-based visualizations. We employ sequence clustering techniques to find patient groups with distinctive progression patterns, and to reveal the association between disease progression and patient-level features. The design and development were driven by a requirement analysis and iteratively refined based on feedback from domain experts over the course of a 10-month design study. Case studies and expert interviews demonstrate that ThreadStates can successively summarize disease states, reveal disease progression, and compare patient groups.",ThreadStates: State-based Visual Analysis of Disease Progression,,App,2021
"How to achieve academic career success has been a long-standing research question in social science research. With the growing availability of large-scale well-documented academic profiles and career trajectories, scholarly interest in career success has been reinvigorated, which has emerged to be an active research domain called the Science of Science (i.e., SciSci). In this study, we adopt an innovative dynamic perspective to examine how individual and social factors will influence career success over time. We propose ACSeeker, an interactive visual analytics approach to explore the potential factors of success and how the influence of multiple factors changes at different stages of academic careers. We first applied a Multi-factor Impact Analysis framework to estimate the effect of different factors on academic career success over time. We then developed a visual analytics system to understand the dynamic effects interactively. A novel timeline is designed to reveal and compare the factor impacts based on the whole population. A customized career line showing the individual career development is provided to allow a detailed inspection. To validate the effectiveness and usability of ACSeeker, we report two case studies and interviews with a social scientist and general researchers.",Seek for Success: A Visualization Approach for Understanding the Dynamics of Academic Careers,,App,2021
"N-ary relationships, which relate N entities where N is not necessarily two, can be visually represented as polygons whose vertices are the entities of the relationships. Manually generating a high-quality layout using this representation is labor-intensive. In this paper, we provide an automatic polygon layout generation algorithm for the visualization of N-ary relationships. At the core of our algorithm is a set of objective functions motivated by a number of design principles that we have identified. These objective functions are then used in an optimization framework that we develop to achieve high-quality layouts. Recognizing the duality between entities and relationships in the data, we provide a second visualization in which the roles of entities and relationships in the original data are reversed. This can lead to additional insight about the data. Furthermore, we enhance our framework for a joint optimization on the primal layout (original data) and the dual layout (where the roles of entities and relationships are reversed). This allows users to inspect their data using two complementary views. We apply our visualization approach to a number of datasets that include co-authorship data and social contact pattern data.",Automatic Polygon Layout for Primal-Dual Visualization of Hypergraphs,,R&I,2021
"Undirected graphs are frequently used to model phenomena that deal with interacting objects, such as social networks, brain activity and communication networks. The topology of an undirected graph G can be captured by an adjacency matrix; this matrix in turn can be visualized directly to give insight into the graph structure. Which visual patterns appear in such a matrix visualization crucially depends on the ordering of its rows and columns. Formally defining the quality of an ordering and then automatically computing a high-quality ordering are both challenging problems; however, effective heuristics exist and are used in practice.
  
  Often, graphs do not exist in isolation but as part of a collection of graphs on the same set of vertices, for example, brain scans over time or of different people. To visualize such graph collections, we need a single ordering that works well for all matrices simultaneously. The current state-of-the-art solves this problem by taking a (weighted) union over all graphs and applying existing heuristics. However, this union leads to a loss of information, specifically in those parts of the graphs which are different. We propose a collection-aware approach to avoid this loss of information and apply it to two popular heuristic methods: leaf order and barycenter.
  
  The de-facto standard computational quality metrics for matrix ordering capture only block-diagonal patterns (cliques). Instead, we propose to use Moran's I, a spatial auto-correlation metric, which captures the full range of established patterns. Moran's I refines previously proposed stress measures. Furthermore, the popular leaf order method heuristically optimizes a similar measure which further supports the use of Moran's I in this context. An ordering that maximizes Moran's I can be computed via solutions to the Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP); approximate orderings can be computed more efficiently, using any of the approximation algorithms for metric TSP.
  
  We evaluated our methods for simultaneous orderings on real-world datasets using Moran's I as the quality metric. Our results show that our collection-aware approach matches or improves performance compared to the union approach, depending on the similarity of the graphs in the collection. Specifically, our Moran's I-based collection-aware leaf order implementation consistently outperforms other implementations. Our collection-aware implementations carry no significant additional computational costs.",Simultaneous Matrix Orderings for Graph Collections,,S&R,2021
"Although cancer patients survive years after oncologic therapy, they are plagued with long-lasting or permanent residual symptoms, whose severity, rate of development, and resolution after treatment vary largely between survivors. The analysis and interpretation of symptoms is complicated by their partial co-occurrence, variability across populations and across time, and, in the case of cancers that use radiation, by further symptom dependency on the prescribed therapy. We describe an integrated environment for visual analysis and knowledge discovery from cancer therapy symptom data, developed in close collaboration with oncology experts. Our visual environment leverages unsupervised machine learning methodology over cohorts of patients, and, in conjunction with custom visual encodings and interactions, provides context for new patients based on patients with similar diagnostic features and symptom evolution. We evaluate this environment on data collected from a cohort of head and neck cancer patients. Feedback from our clinician collaborators indicates that this environment supports knowledge discovery beyond the limits of machines or humans alone, and that it serves as a valuable tool in both the clinic and symptom research.",THALIS: Human-Machine Analysis of Longitudinal Symptoms in Cancer Therapy,,App,2021
"Zero-shot classification is a promising paradigm to solve an applicable problem when the training classes and test classes are disjoint. Achieving this usually needs experts to externalize their domain knowledge by manually specifying a class-attribute matrix to define which classes have which attributes. Designing a suitable class-attribute matrix is the key to the subsequent procedure, but this design process is tedious and trial-and-error with no guidance. This paper proposes a visual explainable active learning approach with its design and implementation called semantic navigator to solve the above problems. This approach promotes human-AI teaming with four actions (ask, explain, recommend, respond) in each interaction loop. The machine asks contrastive questions to guide humans in the thinking process of attributes. A novel visualization called semantic map explains the current status of the machine. Therefore analysts can better understand why the machine misclassifies objects. Moreover, the machine recommends the labels of classes for each attribute to ease the labeling burden. Finally, humans can steer the model by modifying the labels interactively, and the machine adjusts its recommendations. The visual explainable active learning approach improves humans' efficiency of building zero-shot classification models interactively, compared with the method without guidance. We justify our results with user studies using the standard benchmarks for zero-shot classification.",Towards Visual Explainable Active Learning for Zero-Shot Classification,,A&D,2021
"Time-series data—usually presented in the form of lines—plays an important role in many domains such as finance, meteorology, health, and urban informatics. Yet, little has been done to support interactive exploration of large-scale time-series data, which requires a clutter-free visual representation with low-latency interactions. In this paper, we contribute a novel line-segment-based KD-tree method to enable interactive analysis of many time series. Our method enables not only fast queries over time series in selected regions of interest but also a line splatting method for efficient computation of the density field and selection of representative lines. Further, we develop KD-Box, an interactive system that provides rich interactions, e.g., timebox, attribute filtering, and coordinated multiple views. We demonstrate the effectiveness of KD-Box in supporting efficient line query and density field computation through a quantitative comparison and show its usefulness for interactive visual analysis on several real-world datasets.",KD-Box: Line-segment-based KD-tree for Interactive Exploration of Large-scale Time-Series Data,,S&R,2021
"Machine learning (ML) is being applied to a diverse and ever-growing set of domains. In many cases, domain experts --- who often have no expertise in ML or data science --- are asked to use ML predictions to make high-stakes decisions. Multiple ML usability challenges can appear as result, such as lack of user trust in the model, inability to reconcile human-ML disagreement, and ethical concerns about oversimplification of complex problems to a single algorithm output. In this paper, we investigate the ML usability challenges that present in the domain of child welfare screening through a series of collaborations with child welfare screeners. Following the iterative design process between the ML scientists, visualization researchers, and domain experts (child screeners), we first identified four key ML challenges and honed in on one promising explainable ML technique to address them (local factor contributions). Then we designed, implemented, and evaluated our visual analytics tool, Sibyl, to increase the interpretability and interactivity of local factor contributions. The effectiveness of our tool is demonstrated by two formal user studies with 12 non-expert participants and 13 expert participants respectively. Valuable feedback is collected, from which we also composed a list of design implications as a useful guideline for researchers that aim to develop an interpretable and interactive visualization tool for ML prediction models deployed for child welfare screeners and other similar domain experts.",Sibyl: Understanding and Addressing the Usability Challenges of Machine Learning In High-Stakes Decision Making,,App,2021
"Semantic segmentation is a critical component in autonomous driving and has to be thoroughly evaluated due to safety concerns. Deep neural network (DNN) based semantic segmentation models are widely used in autonomous driving. However, it is challenging to evaluate DNN-based models due to their black-box-like nature, and it is even more difficult to assess model performance for crucial objects, such as lost cargos and pedestrians, in autonomous driving applications. In this work, we propose VASS, a Visual Analytics approach to diagnosing and improving the accuracy and robustness of Semantic Segmentation models, especially for critical objects moving in various driving scenes. The key component of our approach is a context-aware spatial representation learning that extracts important spatial information of objects, such as position, size, and aspect ratio, with respect to given scene contexts. Based on this spatial representation, we first use it to create visual summarization to analyze models’ performance. We then use it to guide the generation of adversarial examples to evaluate models’ spatial robustness and obtain actionable insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of VASS via two case studies of lost cargo detection and pedestrian detection in autonomous driving. For both cases, we show quantitative evaluation on the improvement of models’ performance with actionable insights obtained from VASS.",Where Can We Help?

"Building a visual overview of temporal event sequences with an optimal level-of-detail (i.e. simplified but informative) is an ongoing challenge - expecting the user to zoom into every important aspect of the overview can lead to missing insights. We propose a technique to build and explore a multilevel overview of event sequences, from coarse to fine vertical or horizontal level-of-detail, using hierarchical aggregation and a novel cluster data representation Align-Score-Simplify. By default, the overview shows an optimal number of sequence clusters obtained through the average silhouette width metric – then users are able to explore alternative optimal sequence clusterings. The vertical level-of-detail of the overview changes along with the number of clusters, whilst the horizontal level-of-detail refers to the level of summarization applied to each cluster representation. The proposed technique has been implemented into a visualization system called Sequence Cluster Explorer (Sequen-C) that allows multilevel and detail-on-demand exploration through three coordinated views, and the inspection of data attributes at cluster, unique sequence, and individual sequence level. We present two case studies using real-world datasets in the healthcare domain: CUREd and MIMIC-III, which demonstrate how the technique can aid users in exploring and defining a set of distinct pathways that best summarize the dataset, while also being able of identifying deviating pathways and exploring data attributes for selected patterns.",Sequen-C: A Multilevel Overview of Temporal Event Sequences,,A&D,2021
"Quantum computing has attracted considerable public attention due to its exponential speedup over classical computing. Despite its advantages, today’s quantum computers intrinsically suffer from noise and are error-prone. To guarantee the high fidelity of the execution result of a quantum algorithm, it is crucial to inform users of the noises of the used quantum computer and the compiled physical circuits. However, an intuitive and systematic way to make users aware of the quantum computing noise is still missing. In this paper, we fill the gap by proposing a novel visualization approach to achieve noise-aware quantum computing. It provides a holistic picture of the noise of quantum computing through multiple interactively coordinated views: a Computer Evolution View with a circuit-like design overviews the temporal evolution of the noises of different quantum computers, a Circuit Filtering View facilitates quick filtering of multiple compiled physical circuits for the same quantum algorithm, and a Circuit Comparison View with a coupled bar chart enables detailed comparison of the filtered compiled circuits.

"What can we learn about a scene by watching it for months or years? A video recorded over a long timespan will depict interesting phenomena at multiple timescales, but identifying and viewing them presents a challenge. The video is too long to watch in full, and some things are too slow to experience in real-time, such as glacial retreat or the gradual shift from summer to fall. Timelapse videography is a common approach to summarizing long videos and visualizing slow timescales. However, a timelapse is limited to a single chosen temporal frequency, and often appears flickery due to aliasing. Also, the length of the timelapse video is directly tied to its temporal resolution, which necessitates tradeoffs between those two facets. In this paper, we propose Video Temporal Pyramids, a technique that addresses these limitations and expands the possibilities for visualizing the passage of time. Inspired by spatial image pyramids from computer vision, we developed an algorithm that builds video pyramids in the temporal domain. Each level of a Video Temporal Pyramid visualizes a different timescale; for instance, videos from the monthly timescale are usually good for visualizing seasonal changes, while videos from the one-minute timescale are best for visualizing sunrise or the movement of clouds across the sky. To help explore the different pyramid levels, we also propose a Video Spectrogram to visualize the amount of activity across the entire pyramid, providing a holistic overview of the scene dynamics and the ability to explore and discover phenomena across time and timescales. To demonstrate our approach, we have built Video Temporal Pyramids from ten outdoor scenes, each containing months or years of data. We compare Video Temporal Pyramid layers to naive timelapse and find that our pyramids enable alias-free viewing of longer-term changes. We also demonstrate that the Video Spectrogram facilitates exploration and discovery of phenomena across pyramid levels, by enabling both overview and detail-focused perspectives.",Visualizing the Passage of Time with Video Temporal Pyramids,,DTr,2022
"Visualization research often focuses on perceptual accuracy or helping readers interpret key messages. However, we know very little about how chart designs might influence readers' perceptions of the people behind the data. Specifically, could designs interact with readers' social cognitive biases in ways that perpetuate harmful stereotypes? For example, when analyzing social inequality, bar charts are a popular choice to present outcome disparities between race, gender, or other groups. But bar charts may encourage deficit thinking, the perception that outcome disparities are caused by groups’ personal strengths or deficiencies, rather than external factors. These faulty personal attributions can then reinforce stereotypes about the groups being visualized. We conducted four experiments examining design choices that influence attribution biases (and therefore deficit thinking). Crowdworkers viewed visualizations depicting social outcomes that either mask variability in data, such as bar charts or dot plots, or emphasize variability in data, such as jitter plots or prediction intervals. They reported their agreement with both personal and external explanations for the visualized disparities. Overall, when participants saw visualizations that hide within-group variability, they agreed more with personal explanations. When they saw visualizations that emphasize within-group variability, they agreed less with personal explanations. These results demonstrate that data visualizations about social inequity can be misinterpreted in harmful ways and lead to stereotyping. Design choices can influence these biases: Hiding variability tends to increase stereotyping while emphasizing variability reduces it.",Dispersion vs Disparity: Hiding Variability Can Encourage Stereotyping When Visualizing Social Outcomes,,T&E,2022
"Fostering data visualization literacy (DVL) as part of childhood education could lead to a more data literate society. However, most work in DVL for children relies on a more formal educational context (i.e., a teacher-led approach) that limits children's engagement with data to classroom-based environments and, consequently, children's ability to ask questions about and explore data on topics they find personally meaningful. We explore how a curiosity-driven, child-led approach can provide more agency to children when they are authoring data visualizations. This paper explores how informal learning with crafting physicalizations through play and curiosity may foster increased literacy and engagement with data. Employing a constructionist approach, we designed a do-it-yourself toolkit made out of everyday materials (e.g., paper, cardboard, mirrors) that enables children to create, customize, and personalize three different interactive visualizations (bar, line, pie). We used the toolkit as a design probe in a series of in-person workshops with 5 children (6 to 11-year-olds) and interviews with 5 educators. Our observations reveal that the toolkit helped children creatively engage and interact with visualizations. Children with prior knowledge of data visualization reported the toolkit serving as more of an authoring tool that they envision using in their daily lives, while children with little to no experience found the toolkit as an engaging introduction to data visualization. Our study demonstrates the potential of using the constructionist approach to cultivate children's DVL through curiosity and play.",Cultivating Visualization Literacy for Children through Curiosity and Play,,R&I,2022
"We present Animated Vega-Lite, a set of extensions to Vega-Lite that model animated visualizations as time-varying data queries. In contrast to alternate approaches for specifying animated visualizations, which prize a highly expressive design space, Animated Vega-Lite prioritizes unifying animation with the language’s existing abstractions for static and interactive visualizations to enable authors to smoothly move between or combine these modalities. Thus, to compose animation with static visualizations, we represent time as an encoding channel. Time encodings map a data field to animation keyframes, providing a lightweight specification for animations without interaction. To compose animation and interaction, we also represent time as an event stream; Vega-Lite selections, which provide dynamic data queries, are now driven not only by input events but by timer ticks as well. We evaluate the expressiveness of our approach through a gallery of diverse examples that demonstrate coverage over taxonomies of both interaction and animation. We also critically reflect on the conceptual affordances and limitations of our contribution by interviewing five expert developers of existing animation grammars. These reflections highlight the key motivating role of in-the-wild examples, and identify three central tradeoffs: the language design process, the types of animated transitions supported, and how the systems model keyframes.",Animated Vega-Lite: Unifying Animation with a Grammar of Interactive Graphics,,R&I,2022
"Promotions are commonly used by e-commerce merchants to boost sales. The efficacy of different promotion strategies can help sellers adapt their offering to customer demand in order to survive and thrive. Current approaches to designing promotion strategies are either based on econometrics, which may not scale to large amounts of sales data, or are spontaneous and provide little explanation of sales volume. Moreover, accurately measuring the effects of promotion designs and making bootstrappable adjustments accordingly remains a challenge due to the incompleteness and complexity of the information describing promotion strategies and their market environments. We present PromotionLens, a visual analytics system for exploring, comparing, and modeling the impact of various promotion strategies. Our approach combines representative multivariant time-series forecasting models and well-designed visualizations to demonstrate and explain the impact of sales and promotional factors, and to support ""what-if"" analysis of promotions. Two case studies, expert feedback, and a qualitative user study demonstrate the efficacy of PromotionLens.",PromotionLens: Inspecting Promotion Strategies of Online E-commerce via Visual Analytics,,App,2022
"Restructuring the regional industrial structure (RIS) has the potential to halt economic recession and achieve revitalization. Understanding the current status and dynamics of RIS will greatly assist in studying and evaluating the current industrial structure. Previous studies have focused on qualitative and quantitative research to rationalize RIS from a macroscopic perspective. Although recent studies have traced information at the industrial enterprise level to complement existing research from a micro perspective, the ambiguity of the underlying variables contributing to the industrial sector and its composition, the dynamic nature, and the large number of multivariant features of RIS records have obscured a deep and fine-grained understanding of RIS. To this end, we propose an interactive visualization system, RISeer, which is based on interpretable machine learning models and enhanced visualizations designed to identify the evolutionary patterns of the RIS and facilitate inter-regional inspection and comparison. Two case studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach, and feedback from experts indicates that RISeer helps them to gain a fine-grained understanding of the dynamics and evolution of the RIS.",RISeer: Inspecting the Status and Dynamics of Regional Industrial Structure via Visual Analytics,,App,2022
"Sports game data is becoming increasingly complex, often consisting of multivariate data such as player performance stats, historical team records, and athletes’ positional tracking information. While numerous visual analytics systems have been developed for sports analysts to derive insights, few tools target fans to improve their understanding and engagement of sports data during live games. By presenting extra data in the actual game views, embedded visualization has the potential to enhance fans’ game-viewing experience. However, little is known about how to design such kinds of visualizations embedded into live games. In this work, we present a user-centered design study of developing interactive embedded visualizations for basketball fans to improve their live game-watching experiences. We first conducted a formative study to characterize basketball fans’ in-game analysis behaviors and tasks. Based on our findings, we propose a design framework to inform the design of embedded visualizations based on specific data-seeking contexts. Following the design framework, we present five novel embedded visualization designs targeting five representative contexts identified by the fans, including shooting, offense, defense, player evaluation, and team comparison. We then developed Omnioculars, an interactive basketball game-viewing prototype that features the proposed embedded visualizations for fans’ in-game data analysis. We evaluated Omnioculars in a simulated basketball game with basketball fans. The study results suggest that our design supports personalized in-game data analysis and enhances game understanding and engagement.",The Quest for Omnioculars: Embedded Visualization for Augmenting Basketball Game Viewing Experiences,,App,2022
"The interpretation of colors in visualizations is facilitated when the assignments between colors and concepts in the visualizations match human’s expectations, implying that the colors can be interpreted in a semantic manner. However, manually creating a dataset of suitable associations between colors and concepts for use in visualizations is costly, as such associations would have to be collected from humans for a large variety of concepts. To address the challenge of collecting this data, we introduce a method to extract color-concept associations automatically from a set of concept images. While the state-of-the-art method extracts associations from data with supervised learning, we developed a self-supervised method based on colorization that does not require the preparation of ground truth color-concept associations. Our key insight is that a set of images of a concept should be sufficient for learning color-concept associations, since humans also learn to associate colors to concepts mainly from past visual input. Thus, we propose to use an automatic colorization method to extract statistical models of the color-concept associations that appear in concept images. Specifically, we take a colorization model pre-trained on ImageNet and fine-tune it on the set of images associated with a given concept, to predict pixel-wise probability distributions in Lab color space for the images. Then, we convert the predicted probability distributions into color ratings for a given color library and aggregate them for all the images of a concept to obtain the final color-concept associations. We evaluate our method using four different evaluation metrics and via a user study. Experiments show that, although the state-of-the-art method based on supervised learning with user-provided ratings is more effective at capturing relative associations, our self-supervised method obtains overall better results according to metrics like Earth Mover’s Distance (EMD) and Entropy Difference (ED), which are closer to human perception of color distributions.",Self-Supervised Color-Concept Association via Image Colorization,,T&E,2022
"Volume data is found in many important scientific and engineering applications. Rendering this data for visualization at high quality and interactive rates for demanding applications such as virtual reality is still not easily achievable even using professional-grade hardware. We introduce FoVolNet --- a method to significantly increase the performance of volume data visualization. We develop a cost-effective foveated rendering pipeline that sparsely samples a volume around a focal point and reconstructs the full-frame using a deep neural network. Foveated rendering is a technique that prioritizes rendering computations around the user's focal point. This approach leverages properties of the human visual system, thereby saving computational resources when rendering data in the periphery of the user's field of vision. Our reconstruction network combines direct and kernel prediction methods to produce fast, stable, and perceptually convincing output. With a slim design and the use of quantization, our method outperforms state-of-the-art neural reconstruction techniques in both end-to-end frame times and visual quality. We conduct extensive evaluations of the system's rendering performance, inference speed, and perceptual properties, and we provide comparisons to competing neural image reconstruction techniques. Our test results show that FoVolNet consistently achieves significant time saving over conventional rendering while preserving perceptual quality.",FoVolNet: Fast Volume Rendering using Foveated Deep Neural Networks,,S&R,2022
"Most real-world datasets contain missing values yet most exploratory data analysis (EDA) systems only support visualising data points with complete cases. This omission may potentially lead the user to biased analyses and insights. Imputation techniques can help estimate the value of a missing data point, but introduces additional uncertainty. In this work, we investigate the effects of visualising imputed values in charts using different ways of representing data imputations and imputation uncertainty—no imputation, mean, 95% confidence intervals, probability density plots, gradient intervals, and hypothetical outcome plots. We focus on scatterplots, which is a commonly used chart type, and conduct a crowdsourced study with 202 participants. We measure users’ bias and precision in performing two tasks—estimating average and detecting trend—and their self-reported confidence in performing these tasks. Our results suggest that, when estimating averages, uncertainty representations may reduce bias but at the cost of decreasing precision. When estimating trend, only hypothetical outcome plots may lead to a small probability of reducing bias while increasing precision. Participants in every uncertainty representation were less certain about their response when compared to the baseline. The findings point towards potential trade-offs in using uncertainty encodings for datasets with a large number of missing values.

"The electrical power grid is a critical infrastructure, with disruptions in transmission having severe repercussions on daily activities, across multiple sectors. To identify, prevent, and mitigate such events, power grids are being refurbished as ‘smart’ systems that include the widespread deployment of GPS-enabled phasor measurement units (PMUs). PMUs provide fast, precise, and time-synchronized measurements of voltage and current, enabling real-time wide-area monitoring and control. However, the potential benefits of PMUs, for analyzing grid events like abnormal power oscillations and load fluctuations, are hindered by the fact that these sensors produce large, concurrent volumes of noisy data. In this paper, we describe working with power grid engineers to investigate how this problem can be addressed from a visual analytics perspective. As a result, we have developed PMU Tracker, an event localization tool that supports power grid operators in visually analyzing and identifying power grid events and tracking their propagation through the power grid’s network. As a part of the PMU Tracker interface, we develop a novel visualization technique which we term an epicentric cluster dendrogram, which allows operators to analyze the effects of an event as it propagates outwards from a source location. We robustly validate PMU Tracker with: (1) a usage scenario demonstrating how PMU Tracker can be used to analyze anomalous grid events, and (2) case studies with power grid operators using a real-world interconnection dataset. Our results indicate that PMU Tracker effectively supports the analysis of power grid events; we also demonstrate and discuss how PMU Tracker’s visual analytics approach can be generalized to other domains composed of time-varying networks with epicentric event characteristics.",PMU Tracker: A Visualization Platform for Epicentric Event Propagation Analysis in the Power Grid,,App,2022
"While visualizations are an effective way to represent insights about information, they rarely stand alone. When designing a visualization, text is often added to provide additional context and guidance for the reader. However, there is little experimental evidence to guide designers as to what is the right amount of text to show within a chart, what its qualitative properties should be, and where it should be placed. Prior work also shows variation in personal preferences for charts versus textual representations. In this paper, we explore several research questions about the relative value of textual components of visualizations. 302 participants ranked univariate line charts containing varying amounts of text, ranging from no text (except for the axes) to a written paragraph with no visuals. Participants also described what information they could take away from line charts with text having varying semantic content. We find that heavily annotated charts were not penalized. In fact, participants preferred the charts with the largest number of textual annotations over charts with fewer annotations or text alone. We also find effects of semantic content. For instance, the text that describes statistical or relational components of a chart leads to more takeaways regarding statistics or relational comparisons than text describing elemental or encoded components. Finally, we found different effects for the semantic levels based on the placement of the text on the chart; some kinds of information are best placed in the title, while others should be placed closer to the data. These results have important implications for chart design guidelines and future work pertaining to the combination of text and charts.",Striking a Balance: Reader Takeaways and Preferences when Integrating Text and Charts,,T&E,2022
"There has been substantial growth in the use of JSON-based grammars, as well as other standard data serialization languages, to create visualizations. Each of these grammars serves a purpose: some focus on particular computational tasks (such as animation), some are concerned with certain chart types (such as maps), and some target specific data domains (such as ML). Despite the prominence of this interface form, there has been little detailed analysis of the characteristics of these languages. In this study, we survey and analyze the design and implementation of 57 JSON-style DSLs for visualization. We analyze these languages supported by a collected corpus of examples for each DSL (consisting of 4395 instances) across a variety of axes organized into concerns related to domain, conceptual model, language relationships, affordances, and general practicalities. We identify tensions throughout these areas, such as between formal and colloquial specifications, among types of users, and within the composition of languages. Through this work, we seek to support language implementers by elucidating the choices, opportunities, and tradeoffs in visualization DSL design.",No Grammar to Rule Them All: A Survey of JSON-style DSLs for Visualization,,T&E,2022
"During the COVID-19 pandemic, a number of data visualizations were created to inform the public about the rapidly evolving crisis. Data dashboards, a form of information dissemination used during the pandemic, have facilitated this process by visualizing statistics regarding the number of COVID-19 cases over time. Prior work on COVID-19 visualizations has primarily focused on the design and evaluation of specific visualization systems from technology-centered perspectives. However, little is known about what occurs behind the scenes during the visualization creation processes, given the complex sociotechnical contexts in which they are embedded. Yet, such ecological knowledge is necessary to help characterize the nuances and trajectories of visualization design practices in the wild, as well as generate insights into how creators come to understand and approach visualization design on their own terms and for their own situated purposes. In this research, we conducted a qualitative interview study among dashboard creators from federal agencies, state health departments, mainstream news media outlets, and other organizations that created (often widely-used) COVID-19 dashboards to answer the following questions: how did visualization creators engage in COVID-19 dashboard design, and what tensions, conflicts, and challenges arose during this process? Our findings detail the trajectory of design practices---from creation to expansion, maintenance, and termination---that are shaped by the complex interplay between design goals, tools and technologies, labor, emerging crisis contexts, and public engagement. We particularly examined the tensions between designers and the general public involved in these processes. These conflicts, which often materialized due to a divergence between public demands and standing policies, centered around the type and amount of information to be visualized, how public perceptions shape and are shaped by visualization design, and the strategies utilized to deal with (potential) misinterpretations and misuse of visualizations. Our findings and lessons learned shed light on new ways of thinking in visualization design, focusing on the bundled activities that are invariably involved in human and nonhuman participation throughout the entire trajectory of design practice.",Visualization Design Practices in a Crisis: Behind the Scenes with COVID-19 Dashboard Creators,,T&E,2022
"This article reports on an in-depth study that investigates barriers to network exploration with visualizations. Network visualization tools are becoming increasingly popular, but little is known about how analysts plan and engage in the visual exploration of network data—which exploration strategies they employ, and how they prepare their data, define questions, and decide on visual mappings. Our study involved a series of workshops, interaction logging, and observations from a 6-week network exploration course. Our findings shed light on the stages that define analysts’ approaches to network visualization and barriers experienced by some analysts during their network visualization processes. These barriers mainly appear before using a specific tool and include defining exploration goals, identifying relevant network structures and abstractions, or creating appropriate visual mappings for their network data. Our findings inform future work in visualization education and analyst-centered network visualization tool design.",Understanding Barriers to Network Exploration with Visualization: A Report from the Trenches,,T&E,2022
"Analyzing classification model performance is a crucial task for machine learning practitioners. While practitioners often use count-based metrics derived from confusion matrices, like accuracy, many applications, such as weather prediction, sports betting, or patient risk prediction, rely on a classifier's predicted probabilities rather than predicted labels. In these instances, practitioners are concerned with producing a calibrated model, that is, one which outputs probabilities that reflect those of the true distribution. Model calibration is often analyzed visually, through static reliability diagrams, however, the traditional calibration visualization may suffer from a variety of drawbacks due to the strong aggregations it necessitates. Furthermore, count-based approaches are unable to sufficiently analyze model calibration. We present Calibrate, an interactive reliability diagram that addresses the aforementioned issues. Calibrate constructs a reliability diagram that is resistant to drawbacks in traditional approaches, and allows for interactive subgroup analysis and instance-level inspection. We demonstrate the utility of Calibrate through use cases on both real-world and synthetic data. We further validate Calibrate by presenting the results of a think-aloud experiment with data scientists who routinely analyze model calibration.",Calibrate: Interactive Analysis of Probabilistic Model Output,,A&D,2022
"The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) describes the distribution of random variables from several different populations. GMMs have widespread applications in probability theory, statistics, machine learning for unsupervised cluster analysis and topic modeling, as well as in deep learning pipelines. So far, few efforts have been made to explore the underlying point distribution in combination with the GMMs, in particular when the data becomes high-dimensional and when the GMMs are composed of many Gaussians. We present an analysis tool comprising various GPU-based visualization techniques to explore such complex GMMs. To facilitate the exploration of high-dimensional data, we provide a novel navigation system to analyze the underlying data. Instead of projecting the data to 2D, we utilize interactive 3D views to better support users in understanding the spatial arrangements of the Gaussian distributions. The interactive system is composed of two parts: (1) raycasting-based views that visualize cluster memberships, spatial arrangements, and support the discovery of new modes. (2) overview visualizations that enable the comparison of Gaussians with each other, as well as small multiples of different choices of basis vectors. Users are supported in their exploration with customization tools and smooth camera navigations. Our tool was developed and assessed by five domain experts, and its usefulness was evaluated with 23 participants. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we identify interesting features in several data sets.",GRay: Ray Casting for Visualization and Interactive Data Exploration of Gaussian Mixture Models,,S&R,2022
"Neural language models are widely used; however, their model parameters often need to be adapted to the specific domains and tasks of an application, which is time- and resource-consuming. Thus, adapters have recently been introduced as a lightweight alternative for model adaptation. They consist of a small set of task-specific parameters with a reduced training time and simple parameter composition. The simplicity of adapter training and composition comes along with new challenges, such as maintaining an overview of adapter properties and effectively comparing their produced embedding spaces. To help developers overcome these challenges, we provide a twofold contribution. First, in close collaboration with NLP researchers, we conducted a requirement analysis for an approach supporting adapter evaluation and detected, among others, the need for both intrinsic (i.e., embedding similarity-based) and extrinsic (i.e., prediction-based) explanation methods. Second, motivated by the gathered requirements, we designed a flexible visual analytics workspace that enables the comparison of adapter properties. In this paper, we discuss several design iterations and alternatives for interactive, comparative visual explanation methods. Our comparative visualizations show the differences in the adapted embedding vectors and prediction outcomes for diverse human-interpretable concepts (e.g., person names, human qualities). We evaluate our workspace through case studies and show that, for instance, an adapter trained on the language debiasing task according to context-0 (decontextualized) embeddings introduces a new type of bias where words (even gender-independent words such as countries) become more similar to female- than male pronouns. We demonstrate that these are artifacts of context-0 embeddings, and the adapter effectively eliminates the gender information from the contextualized word representations.",Visual Comparison of Language Model Adaptation,,App,2022
"We developed and validated a rating scale to assess the aesthetic pleasure (or beauty) of a visual data representation: the BeauVis scale. With our work we offer researchers and practitioners a simple instrument to compare the visual appearance of different visualizations, unrelated to data or context of use. Our rating scale can, for example, be used to accompany results from controlled experiments or be used as informative data points during in-depth qualitative studies. Given the lack of an aesthetic pleasure scale dedicated to visualizations, researchers have mostly chosen their own terms to study or compare the aesthetic pleasure of visualizations. Yet, many terms are possible and currently no clear guidance on their effectiveness regarding the judgment of aesthetic pleasure exists. To solve this problem, we engaged in a multi-step research process to develop the first validated rating scale specifically for judging the aesthetic pleasure of a visualization (osf.io/fxs76). Our final BeauVis scale consists of five items, “enjoyable,” “likable,” “pleasing,” “nice,” and “appealing.” Beyond this scale itself, we contribute (a) a systematic review of the terms used in past research to capture aesthetics, (b) an investigation with visualization experts who suggested terms to use for judging the aesthetic pleasure of a visualization, and (c) a confirmatory survey in which we used our terms to study the aesthetic pleasure of a set of 3 visualizations.",BeauVis: A Validated Scale for Measuring the Aesthetic Pleasure of Visual Representations,,A&D,2022
"Co-adaptive guidance aims to enable efficient human-machine collaboration in visual analytics, as proposed by multiple theoretical frameworks. This paper bridges the gap between such conceptual frameworks and practical implementation by introducing an accessible model of guidance and an accompanying guidance library, mapping theory into practice. We contribute a model of system-provided guidance based on design templates and derived strategies. We instantiate the model in a library called Lotse that allows specifying guidance strategies in definition files and generates running code from them. Lotse is the first guidance library using such an approach. It supports the creation of reusable guidance strategies to retrofit existing applications with guidance and fosters the creation of general guidance strategy patterns. We demonstrate its effectiveness through first-use case studies with VA researchers of varying guidance design expertise and find that they are able to effectively and quickly implement guidance with Lotse. Further, we analyze our framework's cognitive dimensions to evaluate its expressiveness and outline a summary of open research questions for aligning guidance practice with its intricate theory.",Lotse: A Practical Framework for Guidance in Visual Analytics,,S&R,2022
"Computational modeling is a commonly used technology in many scientific disciplines and has played a noticeable role in combating the COVID-19 pandemic. Modeling scientists conduct sensitivity analysis frequently to observe and monitor the behavior of a model during its development and deployment. The traditional algorithmic ranking of sensitivity of different parameters usually does not provide modeling scientists with sufficient information to understand the interactions between different parameters and model outputs, while modeling scientists need to observe a large number of model runs in order to gain actionable information for parameter optimization. To address the above challenge, we developed and compared two visual analytics approaches, namely: algorithm-centric and visualization-assisted, and visualization-centric and algorithm-assisted. We evaluated the two approaches based on a structured analysis of different tasks in visual sensitivity analysis as well as the feedback of domain experts. While the work was carried out in the context of epidemiological modeling, the two approaches developed in this work are directly applicable to a variety of modeling processes featuring time series outputs, and can be extended to work with models with other types of outputs.",Development and Evaluation of Two Approaches of Visual Sensitivity Analysis to Support Epidemiological Modeling,,App,2022
"Horizontal federated learning (HFL) enables distributed clients to train a shared model and keep their data privacy. In training high-quality HFL models, the data heterogeneity among clients is one of the major concerns. However, due to the security issue and the complexity of deep learning models, it is challenging to investigate data heterogeneity across different clients. To address this issue, based on a requirement analysis we developed a visual analytics tool, HetVis, for participating clients to explore data heterogeneity. We identify data heterogeneity through comparing prediction behaviors of the global federated model and the stand-alone model trained with local data. Then, a context-aware clustering of the inconsistent records is done, to provide a summary of data heterogeneity. Combining with the proposed comparison techniques, we develop a novel set of visualizations to identify heterogeneity issues in HFL. We designed three case studies to introduce how HetVis can assist client analysts in understanding different types of heterogeneity issues. Expert reviews and a comparative study demonstrate the effectiveness of HetVis.",HetVis: A Visual Analysis Approach for Identifying Data Heterogeneity in Horizontal Federated Learning,,App,2022
"Real-world machine learning applications need to be thoroughly evaluated to meet critical product requirements for model release, to ensure fairness for different groups or individuals, and to achieve a consistent performance in various scenarios. For example, in autonomous driving, an object classification model should achieve high detection rates under different conditions of weather, distance, etc. Similarly, in the financial setting, credit-scoring models must not discriminate against minority groups. These conditions or groups are called as “Data Slices”. In product MLOps cycles, product developers must identify such critical data slices and adapt models to mitigate data slice problems. Discovering where models fail, understanding why they fail, and mitigating these problems, are therefore essential tasks in the MLOps life-cycle. In this paper, we present SliceTeller, a novel tool that allows users to debug, compare and improve machine learning models driven by critical data slices. SliceTeller automatically discovers problematic slices in the data, helps the user understand why models fail. More importantly, we present an efficient algorithm, SliceBoosting, to estimate trade-offs when prioritizing the optimization over certain slices. Furthermore, our system empowers model developers to compare and analyze different model versions during model iterations, allowing them to choose the model version best suitable for their applications. We evaluate our system with three use cases, including two real-world use cases of product development, to demonstrate the power of SliceTeller in the debugging and improvement of product-quality ML models.",SliceTeller : A Data Slice-Driven Approach for Machine Learning Model Validation,,A&D,2022
"Spatial statistical analysis of multivariate volumetric data can be challenging due to scale, complexity, and occlusion. Advances in topological segmentation, feature extraction, and statistical summarization have helped overcome the challenges.

The resulting data structures organize features into a coherent nested hierarchy to support flexible and efficient out-of-core region-of-interest extraction. Next, we provide an efficient parallel implementation. Finally, an interactive visualization system based on this approach is designed and then applied to turbulent combustion data.

In a crowd-sourced user study (n = 150), we measure the task accuracy and completion time of the three representations for different network classes and properties. In contrast to the literature, which covers mostly topology-based tasks (e.g., path finding) in small datasets, we mainly focus on overview tasks for large and directed networks. We consider three overview tasks on networks with 500 nodes: (T1) network class identification, (T2) cluster detection, and (T3) network density estimation, and two detailed tasks: (T4) node in-degree vs. out-degree and (T5) representation mapping, on networks with 50 and 20 nodes, respectively. Our results show that bipartite layouts are beneficial for revealing the overall network structure, while adjacency matrices are most reliable across the different tasks.","Comparative Evaluation of Bipartite, Node-Link, and Matrix-Based Network Representations",,T&E,2022
"Visualizations today are used across a wide range of languages and cultures. Yet the extent to which language impacts how we reason about data and visualizations remains unclear. In this paper, we explore the intersection of visualization and language through a cross-language study on estimative probability tasks with icon-array visualizations. Across Arabic, English, French, German, and Mandarin, n = 50 participants per language both chose probability expressions — e.g. likely, probable — to describe icon-array visualizations (Vis-to-Expression), and drew icon-array visualizations to match a given expression (Expression-to-Vis). Results suggest that there is no clear one-to-one mapping of probability expressions and associated visual ranges between languages. Several translated expressions fell significantly above or below the range of the corresponding English expressions. Compared to other languages, French and German respondents appear to exhibit high levels of consistency between the visualizations they drew and the words they chose. Participants across languages used similar words when describing scenarios above 80% chance, with more variance in expressions targeting mid-range and lower values. We discuss how these results suggest potential differences in the expressiveness of language as it relates to visualization interpretation and design goals, as well as practical implications for translation efforts and future studies at the intersection of languages, culture, and visualization.

"Recent advances in artificial intelligence largely benefit from better neural network architectures. These architectures are a product of a costly process of trial-and-error. To ease this process, we develop ArchExplorer, a visual analysis method for understanding a neural architecture space and summarizing design principles. The key idea behind our method is to make the architecture space explainable by exploiting structural distances between architectures. We formulate the calculation of the pairwise distances as solving an all-pairs shortest path problem. To improve efficiency, we decompose this problem into a set of single-source shortest path problems. The time complexity is reduced from O(kn^2N) to O(knN). Architectures are hierarchically clustered according to the distances between them. A circle-packing-based architecture visualization has been developed to convey both the global relationships between clusters and local neighborhoods of the architectures in each cluster. Two case studies and a post-analysis are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of ArchExplorer in summarizing design principles and selecting better-performing architectures.",Visual Analysis of Neural Architecture Spaces for Summarizing Design Principles,,A&D,2022
"Conventional racket sports training highly relies on coaches' knowledge and experience, leading to biases in the guidance. To solve this problem, smart wearable devices based on Internet of Things technology (IoT) have been extensively investigated to support data-driven training. Considerable studies introduced methods to extract valuable information from the sensor data collected by IoT devices. However, the information cannot provide actionable insights for coaches due to the large data volume and high data dimensions. We proposed an IoT + VA framework, Tac-Trainer, to integrate the sensor data, the information, and coaches' knowledge to facilitate racket sports training. Tac-Trainer consists of four components: device configuration, data interpretation, training optimization, and result visualization. These components collect trainees' kinematic data through IoT devices, transform the data into attributes and indicators, generate training suggestions, and provide an interactive visualization interface for exploration, respectively. We further discuss new research opportunities and challenges inspired by our work from two perspectives, VA for IoT and IoT for VA.",Tac-Trainer: A Visual Analytics System for IoT-based Racket Sports Training,,DTr,2022
"When designing communicative visualizations, we often focus on goals that seek to convey patterns, relations, or comparisons (cognitive learning objectives). We pay less attention to affective intents–those that seek to influence or leverage the audience's opinions, attitudes, or values in some way. Affective objectives may range in outcomes from making the viewer care about the subject, strengthening a stance on an opinion, or leading them to take further action. Because such goals are often considered a violation of perceived ‘neutrality’ or are ‘political,’ designers may resist or be unable to describe these intents, let alone formalize them as learning objectives. While there are notable exceptions–such as advocacy visualizations or persuasive cartography–we find that visualization designers rarely acknowledge or formalize affective objectives. Through interviews with visualization designers, we expand on prior work on using learning objectives as a framework for describing and assessing communicative intent. Specifically, we extend and revise the framework to include a set of affective learning objectives. This structured taxonomy can help designers identify and declare their goals and compare and assess designs in a more principled way. Additionally, the taxonomy can enable external critique and analysis of visualizations. We illustrate the use of the taxonomy with a critical analysis of an affective visualization.",Affective Learning Objectives for Communicative Visualizations,,T&E,2022
"Scientific knowledge develops through cumulative discoveries that build on, contradict, contextualize, or correct prior findings. Scientists and journalists often communicate these incremental findings to lay people through visualizations and text (e.g., the positive and negative effects of caffeine intake). Consequently, readers need to integrate diverse and contrasting evidence from multiple sources to form opinions or make decisions. However, the underlying mechanism for synthesizing information from multiple visualizations remains under-explored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a series of four experiments (N = 1166) in which participants synthesized empirical evidence from a pair of line charts presented sequentially. In Experiment 1, we administered a baseline condition with charts depicting no specific context where participants held no strong belief. To test for the generalizability, we introduced real-world scenarios to our visualizations in Experiment 2 and added accompanying text descriptions similar to online news articles or blog posts in Experiment 3. In all three experiments, we varied the relative direction and magnitude of line slopes within the chart pairs. We found that participants tended to weigh the positive slope more when the two charts depicted relationships in the opposite direction (e.g., one positive slope and one negative slope). Participants tended to weigh the less steep slope more when the two charts depicted relationships in the same direction (e.g., both positive). Through these experiments, we characterize participants' synthesis behaviors depending on the relationship between the information they viewed, contribute to theories describing underlying cognitive mechanisms in information synthesis, and describe design implications for data storytelling.",How Do Viewers Synthesize Conflicting Information from Data Visualizations?,,T&E,2022
"The last decade has witnessed many visual analytics (VA) systems that make successful applications to wide-ranging domains like urban analytics and explainable AI. However, their research rigor and contributions have been extensively challenged within the visualization community. We come in defence of VA systems by contributing two interview studies for gathering critics and responses to those criticisms. First, we interview 24 researchers to collect criticisms the review comments on their VA work. Through an iterative coding and refinement process, the interview feedback is summarized into a list of 36 common criticisms. Second, we interview 17 researchers to validate our list and collect their responses, thereby discussing implications for defending and improving the scientific values and rigor of VA systems. We highlight that the presented knowledge is deep, extensive, but also imperfect, provocative, and controversial, and thus recommend reading with an inclusive and critical eye. We hope our work can provide thoughts and foundations for conducting VA research and spark discussions to promote the research field forward more rigorously and vibrantly.",In Defence of Visual Analytics Systems: Replies to Critics,,T&E,2022
"Projection and ranking are frequently used analysis techniques in multi-attribute data exploration. Both families of techniques help analysts with tasks such as identifying similarities between observations and determining ordered subgroups, and have shown good performances in multi-attribute data exploration. However, they often exhibit problems such as distorted projection layouts, obscure semantic interpretations, and non-intuitive effects produced by selecting a subset of (weighted) attributes. Moreover, few studies have attempted to combine projection and ranking into the same exploration space to complement each other's strengths and weaknesses. For this reason, we propose RankAxis, a visual analytics system that systematically combines projection and ranking to facilitate the mutual interpretation of these two techniques and jointly support multi-attribute data exploration. A real-world case study, expert feedback, and a user study demonstrate the efficacy of RankAxis.",RankAxis: Towards a Systematic Combination of Projection and Ranking in Multi-Attribute Data Exploration,,A&D,2022
"A plethora of dimensionality reduction techniques have emerged over the past decades, leaving researchers and analysts with a wide variety of choices for reducing their data, all the more so given some techniques come with additional hyper-parametrization (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP, etc.). Recent studies are showing that people often use dimensionality reduction as a black-box regardless of the specific properties the method itself preserves. Hence, evaluating and comparing 2D embeddings is usually qualitatively decided, by setting embeddings side-by-side and letting human judgment decide which embedding is the best. In this work, we propose a quantitative way of evaluating embeddings, that nonetheless places human perception at the center. We run a comparative study, where we ask people to select ""good'' and ""misleading'' views between scatterplots of low-dimensional embeddings of image datasets, simulating the way people usually select embeddings. We use the study data as labels for a set of quality metrics for a supervised machine learning model whose purpose is to discover and quantify what exactly people are looking for when deciding between embeddings. With the model as a proxy for human judgments, we use it to rank embeddings on new datasets, explain why they are relevant, and quantify the degree of subjectivity when people select preferred embeddings.",Predicting User Preferences of Dimensionality Reduction Embedding Quality,,T&E,2022
"Flow visualization is essentially a tool to answer domain experts' questions about flow fields using rendered images. Static flow visualization approaches require domain experts to raise their questions to visualization experts, who develop specific techniques to extract and visualize the flow structures of interest. Interactive visualization approaches allow domain experts to ask the system directly through the visual analytic interface, which provides flexibility to support various tasks. However, in practice, the visual analytic interface may require extra learning effort, which often discourages domain experts and limits its usage in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose FlowNL, a novel interactive system with a natural language interface. FlowNL allows users to manipulate the flow visualization system using plain English, which greatly reduces the learning effort. We develop a natural language parser to interpret user intention and translate textual input into a declarative language. We design the declarative language as an intermediate layer between the natural language and the programming language specifically for flow visualization. The declarative language provides selection and composition rules to derive relatively complicated flow structures from primitive objects that encode various kinds of information about scalar fields, flow patterns, regions of interest, connectivities, etc. We demonstrate the effectiveness of FlowNL using multiple usage scenarios and an empirical evaluation.",FlowNL: Asking the Flow Data in Natural Languages,,R&I,2022
"Despite the ever-growing popularity of dashboards across a wide range of domains, their authoring still remains a tedious and complex process. Current tools offer considerable support for creating individual visualizations but provide limited support for discovering groups of visualizations that can be collectively useful for composing analytic dashboards. To address this problem, we present MEDLEY, a mixed-initiative interface that assists in dashboard composition by recommending dashboard collections (i.e., a logically grouped set of views and filtering widgets) that map to specific analytical intents. Users can specify dashboard intents (namely, measure analysis, change analysis, category analysis, or distribution analysis) explicitly through an input panel in the interface or implicitly by selecting data attributes and views of interest. The system recommends collections based on these analytic intents, and views and widgets can be selected to compose a variety of dashboards. MEDLEY also provides a lightweight direct manipulation interface to configure interactions between views in a dashboard. Based on a study with 13 participants performing both targeted and open-ended tasks, we discuss how MEDLEY's recommendations guide dashboard composition and facilitate different user workflows. Observations from the study identify potential directions for future work, including combining manual view specification with dashboard recommendations and designing natural language interfaces for dashboard authoring.",Medley: Intent-based Recommendations to Support Dashboard Composition,,A&D,2022
"We present an extension of multidimensional scaling (MDS) to uncertain data, facilitating uncertainty visualization of multidimensional data. Our approach uses local projection operators that map high-dimensional random vectors to low-dimensional space to formulate a generalized stress. In this way, our generic model supports arbitrary distributions and various stress types. We use our uncertainty-aware multidimensional scaling (UAMDS) concept to derive a formulation for the case of normally distributed random vectors and a squared stress. The resulting minimization problem is numerically solved via gradient descent. We complement UAMDS by additional visualization techniques that address the sensitivity and trustworthiness of dimensionality reduction under uncertainty. With several examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach and the importance of uncertainty-aware techniques.",Uncertainty-Aware Multidimensional Scaling,,DTr,2022
"Data privacy is an essential issue in publishing data visualizations. However, it is challenging to represent multiple data patterns in privacy-preserving visualizations. The prior approaches target specific chart types or perform an anonymization model uniformly without considering the importance of data patterns in visualizations. In this paper, we propose a visual analytics approach that facilitates data custodians to generate multiple private charts while maintaining user-preferred patterns. To this end, we introduce pattern constraints to model users' preferences over data patterns in the dataset and incorporate them into the proposed Bayesian network-based Differential Privacy (DP) model PriVis. A prototype system, DPVisCreator, is developed to assist data custodians in implementing our approach. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated with quantitative evaluation of pattern utility under the different levels of privacy protection, case studies, and semi-structured expert interviews.",DPVisCreator: Incorporating Pattern Constraints to Privacy-preserving Visualizations via Differential Privacy,,A&D,2022
"Deep learning based latent representations have been widely used for numerous scientific visualization applications such as isosurface similarity analysis, volume rendering, flow field synthesis, and data reduction, just to name a few. However, existing latent representations are mostly generated from raw data in an unsupervised manner, which makes it difficult to incorporate domain interest to control the size of the latent representations and the quality of the reconstructed data. In this paper, we present a novel importance-driven latent representation to facilitate domain-interest-guided scientific data visualization and analysis. We utilize spatial importance maps to represent various scientific interests and take them as the input to a feature transformation network to guide latent generation. We further reduced the latent size by a lossless entropy encoding algorithm trained together with the autoencoder, improving the storage and memory efficiency. We qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of latent representations generated by our method with data from multiple scientific visualization applications.",IDLat: An Importance-Driven Latent Generation Method for Scientific Data,,DTr,2022
"Music mood classification has been a challenging problem in comparison with other music classification problems (e.g., genre, composer, or period). One solution for addressing this challenge is to use an ensemble of machine learning models. In this paper, we show that visualization techniques can effectively convey the popular prediction as well as uncertainty at different music sections along the temporal axis while enabling the analysis of individual ML models in conjunction with their application to different musical data. In addition to the traditional visual designs, such as stacked line graph, ThemeRiver, and pixel-based visualization, we introduce a new variant of ThemeRiver, called ``dual-flux ThemeRiver'', which allows viewers to observe and measure the most popular prediction more easily than stacked line graph and ThemeRiver. Together with pixel-based visualization, dual-flux ThemeRiver plots can also assist in model-development workflows, in addition to annotating music using ensemble model predictions.",Visualizing Ensemble Predictions of Music Mood,,A&D,2022
"We present PuzzleFixer, an immersive interactive system for experts to rectify defective reassembled 3D objects. Reassembling the fragments of a broken object to restore its original state is the prerequisite of many analytical tasks such as cultural relics analysis and forensics reasoning. While existing computer-aided methods can automatically reassemble fragments, they often derive incorrect objects due to the complex and ambiguous fragment shapes. Thus, experts usually need to refine the object manually. Prior advances in immersive technologies provide benefits for realistic perception and direct interactions to visualize and interact with 3D fragments. However, few studies have investigated the reassembled object refinement. The specific challenges include: 1) the fragment combination set is too large to determine the correct matches, and 2) the geometry of the fragments is too complex to align them properly. To tackle the first challenge, PuzzleFixer leverages dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, allowing users to review possible match categories, select the matches with reasonable shapes, and drill down to shapes to correct the corresponding faces. For the second challenge, PuzzleFixer embeds the object with node-link networks to augment the perception of match relations. Specifically, it instantly visualizes matches with graph edges and provides force feedback to facilitate the efficiency of alignment interactions. To demonstrate the effectiveness of PuzzleFixer, we conducted an expert evaluation based on two cases on real-world artifacts and collected feedback through post-study interviews. The results suggest that our system is suitable and efficient for experts to refine incorrect reassembled objects.",PuzzleFixer: A Visual Reassembly System for Immersive Fragments Restoration,,S&R,2022
"A series of recent studies has focused on designing cross-resolution and cross-device visualizations, i.e., responsive visualization, a concept adopted from responsive web design. However, these studies mainly focused on visualizations with a single view to a small number of views, and there are still unresolved questions about how to design responsive multi-view visualizations. In this paper, we present a reusable and generalizable framework for designing responsive multi-view visualizations focused on genomics data. To gain a better understanding of existing design challenges, we review web-based genomics visualization tools in the wild. By characterizing tools based on a taxonomy of responsive designs, we find that responsiveness is rarely supported in existing tools. To distill insights from the survey results in a systematic way, we classify typical view composition patterns, such as “vertically long,” “horizontally wide,” “circular,” and “cross-shaped” compositions. We then identify their usability issues in different resolutions that stem from the composition patterns, as well as discussing approaches to address the issues and to make genomics visualizations responsive. By extending the Gosling visualization grammar to support responsive constructs, we show how these approaches can be supported. A valuable follow-up study would be taking different input modalities into account, such as mouse and touch interactions, which was not considered in our study.",Multi-View Design Patterns and Responsive Visualization for Genomics Data,,S&R,2022
"Visualizing sets of elements and their relations is an important research area in information visualization. In this paper, we present MosaicSets: a novel approach to create Euler-like diagrams from non-spatial set systems such that each element occupies one cell of a regular hexagonal or square grid. The main challenge is to find an assignment of the elements to the grid cells such that each set constitutes a contiguous region. As use case, we consider the research groups of a university faculty as elements, and the departments and joint research projects as sets. We aim at finding a suitable mapping between the research groups and the grid cells such that the department structure forms a base map layout. Our objectives are to optimize both the compactness of the entirety of all cells and of each set by itself. We show that computing the mapping is NP-hard. However, using integer linear programming we can solve real-world instances optimally within a few seconds. Moreover, we propose a relaxation of the contiguity requirement to visualize otherwise non-embeddable set systems. 
 We present and discuss different rendering styles for the set overlays. Based on a case study with real-world data, our evaluation comprises quantitative measures as well as expert interviews.",MosaicSets: Embedding Set Systems into Grid Graphs,,S&R,2022
"Experts in racket sports like tennis and badminton use tactical analysis to gain insight into competitors' playing styles. Many data-driven methods apply pattern mining to racket sports data — which is often recorded as multivariate event sequences — to uncover sports tactics. However, tactics obtained in this way are often inconsistent with those deduced by experts through their domain knowledge, which can be confusing to those experts. This work introduces RASIPAM, a RAcket-Sports Interactive PAttern Mining system, which allows experts to incorporate their knowledge into data mining algorithms to discover meaningful tactics interactively. RASIPAM consists of a constraint-based pattern mining algorithm that responds to the analysis demands of experts: Experts provide suggestions for finding tactics in intuitive written language, and these suggestions are translated into constraints to run the algorithm. RASIPAM further introduces a tailored visual interface that allows experts to compare the new tactics with the original ones and decide whether to apply a given adjustment. This interactive workflow iteratively progresses until experts are satisfied with all tactics. We conduct a quantitative experiment to show that our algorithm supports real-time interaction. Two case studies in tennis and in badminton respectively, each involving two domain experts, are conducted to show the effectiveness and usefulness of the system.",RASIPAM: Interactive Pattern Mining of Multivariate Event Sequences in Racket Sports,,A&D,2022
"State-of-the-art neural language models can now be used to solve ad-hoc language tasks through zero-shot prompting without the need for supervised training. This approach has gained popularity in recent years, and researchers have demonstrated prompts that achieve strong accuracy on specific NLP tasks. However, finding a prompt for new tasks requires experimentation. Different prompt templates with different wording choices lead to significant accuracy differences. PromptIDE allows users to experiment with prompt variations, visualize prompt performance, and iteratively optimize prompts. We developed a workflow that allows users to first focus on model feedback using small data before moving on to a large data regime that allows empirical grounding of promising prompts using quantitative measures of the task. The tool then allows easy deployment of the newly created ad-hoc models. We demonstrate the utility of PromptIDE (demo: http://prompt.vizhub.ai) and our workflow using several real-world use cases.",Interactive and visual prompt engineering for ad-hoc task adaptation with large language models,,A&D,2022
"Tabular visualization techniques integrate visual representations with tabular data to avoid additional cognitive load caused by splitting users' attention. However, most of the existing studies focus on simple flat tables instead of hierarchical tables, whose complex structure limits the expressiveness of visualization results and affects users' efficiency in visualization construction. We present HiTailor, a technique for presenting and exploring hierarchical tables. HiTailor constructs an abstract model, which defines row/column headings as biclustering and hierarchical structures. Based on our abstract model, we identify three pairs of operators, Swap/Transpose, ToStacked/ToLinear, Fold/Unfold, for transformations of hierarchical tables to support users' comprehensive explorations. After transformation, users can specify a cell or block of interest in hierarchical tables as a TableUnit for visualization, and HiTailor recommends other related TableUnits according to the abstract model using different mechanisms. We demonstrate the usability of the HiTailor system through a comparative study and a case study with domain experts, showing that HiTailor can present and explore hierarchical tables from different viewpoints. HiTailor is available at https://github.com/bitvis2021/HiTailor.",HiTailor: Interactive Transformation and Visualization for Hierarchical Tabular Data,,App,2022
"As an effective form of narrative visualization, visual data stories are widely used in data-driven storytelling to communicate complex insights and support data understanding. Although important, they are difficult to create, as a variety of interdisciplinary skills, such as data analysis and design, are required. In this work, we introduce Erato, a human-machine cooperative data story editing system, which allows users to generate insightful and fluent data stories together with the computer. Specifically, Erato only requires a number of keyframes provided by the user to briefly describe the topic and structure of a data story. Meanwhile, our system leverages a novel interpolation algorithm to help users insert intermediate frames between the keyframes to smooth the transition. We evaluated the effectiveness and usefulness of the Erato system via a series of evaluations including a Turing test, a controlled user study, a performance validation, and interviews with three expert users. The evaluation results showed that the proposed interpolation technique was able to generate coherent story content and help users create data stories more efficiently.",Erato: Cooperative Data Story Editing via Fact Interpolation,,R&I,2022
"Stylized tubes are an established visualization primitive for line data as encountered in many scientific fields, ranging from characteristic lines in flow fields, fiber tracks reconstructed from diffusion tensor imaging, to trajectories of moving objects as they arise from cyber-physical systems in many engineering disciplines. Typical challenges include large data set sizes demanding for efficient rendering techniques as well as a large number of attributes that cannot be mapped simultaneously to the basic visual attributes provided by a tube-based visualization. In this work, we tackle both challenges with a new on-tube visualization approach. We improve recent work on high-quality GPU ray casting of Hermite spline tubes supporting ambient occlusion and extend it by a new layered procedural texturing technique. In the proposed framework, a large number of data set attributes can be mapped simultaneously to a variety of glyphs and plots that are embedded in texture space and organized in layers. Efficient rendering with minimal data transfer is achieved by generating the glyphs procedurally and drawing them in a deferred shading pass. We integrated these techniques in a prototype visualization tool that facilitates flexible mapping of data set attributes to visual tube and glyph attributes. We studied our approach on a variety of example data from different fields and found it to provide a highly adaptable and extensible toolbox to quickly craft tailor-made tube-based trajectory visualizations.",On-Tube Attribute Visualization for Multivariate Trajectory Data,,S&R,2022
"This paper introduces design patterns for dashboards to inform dashboard design processes. Despite a growing number of public examples, case studies, and general guidelines there is surprisingly little design guidance for dashboards. Such guidance is necessary to inspire designs and discuss tradeoffs in, e.g., screenspace, interaction, or information shown. Based on a systematic review of 144 dashboards, we report on eight groups of design patterns that provide common solutions in dashboard design. We discuss combinations of these patterns in “dashboard genres” such as narrative, analytical, or embedded dashboard. We ran a 2-week dashboard design workshop with 23 participants of varying expertise working on their own data and dashboards. We discuss the application of patterns for the dashboard design processes, as well as general design tradeoffs and common challenges. Our work complements previous surveys and aims to support dashboard designers and researchers in co-creation, structured design decisions, as well as future user evaluations about dashboard design guidelines.

"In a basketball play, players who are not in possession of the ball (i.e., off-ball players) can still effectively contribute to the team’s offense, such as making a sudden move to create scoring opportunities. Analyzing the movements of off-ball players can thus facilitate the development of effective strategies for coaches. However, common basketball statistics (e.g., points and assists) primarily focus on what happens around the ball and are mostly result-oriented, making it challenging to objectively assess and fully understand the contributions of off-ball movements. To address these challenges, we collaborate closely with domain experts and summarize the multi-level requirements for off-ball movement analysis in basketball. We first establish an assessment model to quantitatively evaluate the offensive contribution of an off-ball movement considering both the position of players and the team cooperation. Based on the model, we design and develop a visual analytics system called OBTracker to support the multifaceted analysis of off-ball movements. OBTracker enables users to identify the frequency and effectiveness of off-ball movement patterns and learn the performance of different off-ball players. A tailored visualization based on the Voronoi diagram is proposed to help users interpret the contribution of off-ball movements from a temporal perspective. We conduct two case studies based on the tracking data from NBA games and demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of OBTracker through expert feedback.",OBTracker: Visual Analytics of Off-ball Movements in Basketball,,A&D,2022
"We propose a contrastive dimensionality reduction approach (CDR) for interactive visual cluster analysis. Although dimensionality reduction of high-dimensional data is widely used in visual cluster analysis in conjunction with scatterplots, there are several limitations on effective visual cluster analysis. First, it is non-trivial for an embedding to present clear visual cluster separation when keeping neighborhood structures. Second, as cluster analysis is a subjective task, user steering is required. However, it is also non-trivial to enable interactions in dimensionality reduction. To tackle these problems, we introduce contrastive learning into dimensionality reduction for high-quality embedding. We then redefine the gradient of the loss function to the negative pairs to enhance the visual cluster separation of embedding results. Based on the contrastive learning scheme, we employ link-based interactions to steer embeddings. After that, we implement a prototype visual interface that integrates the proposed algorithms and a set of visualizations. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that CDR outperforms existing techniques in terms of preserving correct neighborhood structures and improving visual cluster separation. The ablation experiment demonstrates the effectiveness of gradient redefinition. The user study verifies that CDR outperforms t-SNE and UMAP in the task of cluster identification. We also showcase two use cases on real-world datasets to present the effectiveness of link-based interactions.",Interactive Visual Cluster Analysis by Contrastive Dimensionality Reduction,,App,2022
"Analytical dashboards are popular in business intelligence to facilitate insight discovery with multiple charts. However, creating an effective dashboard is highly demanding, which requires users to have adequate data analysis background and be familiar with professional tools, such as Power BI. To create a dashboard, users have to configure charts by selecting data columns and exploring different chart combinations to optimize the communication of insights, which is trial-and-error. Recent research has started to use deep learning methods for dashboard generation to lower the burden of visualization creation. However, such efforts are greatly hindered by the lack of large-scale and high-quality datasets of dashboards. In this work, we propose using deep reinforcement learning to generate analytical dashboards that can use well-established visualization knowledge and the estimation capacity of reinforcement learning. Specifically, we use visualization knowledge to construct a training environment and rewards for agents to explore and imitate human exploration behavior with a well-designed agent network. The usefulness of the deep reinforcement learning model is demonstrated through ablation studies and user studies. In conclusion, our work opens up new opportunities to develop effective ML-based visualization recommenders without beforehand training datasets.",DashBot: Insight-Driven Dashboard Generation Based on Deep Reinforcement Learning,,DTr,2022
"Glyph-based visualization achieves an impressive graphic design when associated with comprehensive visual metaphors, which help audiences effectively grasp the conveyed information through revealing data semantics. However, creating such metaphoric glyph-based visualization (MGV) is not an easy task, as it requires not only a deep understanding of data but also professional design skills. This paper proposes MetaGlyph, an automatic system for generating MGVs from a spreadsheet. To develop MetaGlyph, we first conduct a qualitative analysis to understand the design of current MGVs from the perspectives of metaphor embodiment and glyph design. Based on the results, we introduce a novel framework for generating MGVs by metaphoric image selection and an MGV construction. Specifically, MetaGlyph automatically selects metaphors with corresponding images from online resources based on the input data semantics. We then integrate a Monte Carlo tree search algorithm that explores the design of an MGV by associating visual elements with data dimensions given the data importance, semantic relevance, and glyph non-overlap. The system also provides editing feedback that allows users to customize the MGVs according to their design preferences. We demonstrate the use of MetaGlyph through a set of examples, one usage scenario, and validate its effectiveness through a series of expert interviews.",MetaGlyph: Automatic Generation of Metaphoric Glyph-based Visualization,,R&I,2022
"Before seeing a patient for the first time, healthcare workers will typically conduct a comprehensive clinical chart review of the patient's electronic health record (EHR). Within the diverse documentation pieces included there, text notes are among the most important and thoroughly perused segments for this task; and yet they are among the least supported medium in terms of content navigation and overview. In this work, we delve deeper into the task of clinical chart review from a data visualization perspective and propose a hybrid graphics+text approach via ChartWalk, an interactive tool to support the review of text notes in EHRs. We report on our iterative design process grounded in input provided by a diverse range of healthcare professionals, with steps including: (a) initial requirements distilled from interviews and the literature, (b) an interim evaluation to validate design decisions, and (c) a task-based qualitative evaluation of our final design.

"Accessibility guidelines place restrictions on the use of animations and interactivity on webpages to lessen the likelihood of webpages inadvertently producing sequences with flashes, patterns, or color changes that may trigger seizures for individuals with photosensitive epilepsy. Online data visualizations often incorporate elements of animation and interactivity to create a narrative, engage users, or encourage exploration. These design guidelines have been empirically validated by perceptual studies in visualization literature, but the impact of animation and interaction in visualizations on users with photosensitivity, who may experience seizures in response to certain visual stimuli, has not been considered. We systematically gathered and tested 1,132 interactive and animated visualizations for seizure-inducing risk using established methods and found that currently available methods for determining photosensitive risk are not reliable when evaluating interactive visualizations, as risk scores varied significantly based on the individual interacting with the visualization. To address this issue, we introduce a theoretical model defining the degree of control visualization designers have over three determinants of photosensitive risk in potentially seizure-inducing sequences: the size, frequency, and color of flashing content. Using an analysis of 375 visualizations hosted on bl.ocks.org, we created a theoretical model of photosensitive risk in visualizations by arranging the photosensitive risk determinants according to the degree of control visualization authors have over whether content exceeds photosensitive accessibility thresholds. We then use this model to propose a new method of testing for photosensitive risk that focuses on elements of visualizations that are subject to greater authorial control – and are therefore more robust to variations in the individual user – producing more reliable risk assessments than existing methods when applied to interactive visualizations.

"People have expectations about how colors map to concepts in visualizations, and they are better at interpreting visualizations that match their expectations. Traditionally, studies on these expectations (inferred mappings) distinguished distinct factors relevant for visualizations of categorical vs. continuous information. Studies on categorical information focused on direct associations (e.g., mangos are associated with yellows) whereas studies on continuous information focused on relational associations (e.g., darker colors map to larger quantities; dark-is-more bias). We unite these two areas within a single framework of assignment inference. Assignment inference is the process by which people infer mappings between perceptual features and concepts represented in encoding systems. Observers infer globally optimal assignments by maximizing the “merit,” or “goodness,” of each possible assignment. Previous work on assignment inference focused on visualizations of categorical information. We extend this approach to visualizations of continuous data by (a) broadening the notion of merit to include relational associations and (b) developing a method for combining multiple (sometimes conflicting) sources of merit to predict people’s inferred mappings. We developed and tested our model on data from experiments in which participants interpreted colormap data visualizations, representing fictitious data about environmental concepts (sunshine, shade, wild fire, ocean water, glacial ice). We found both direct and relational associations contribute independently to inferred mappings. These results can be used to optimize visualization design to facilitate visual communication.",Unifying Effects of Direct and Relational Associations for Visual Communication,,T&E,2022
"Creating a static visualization for a time-dependent scalar field is a non-trivial task, yet very insightful as it shows the dynamics in one picture. Existing approaches are based on a linearization of the domain or on feature tracking. Domain linearizations use space-filling curves to place all sample points into a 1D domain, thereby breaking up individual features. Feature tracking methods explicitly respect feature continuity in space and time, but generally neglect the data context in which those features live. We present a feature-based linearization of the spatial domain that keeps features together and preserves their context by involving all data samples. We use augmented merge trees to linearize the domain and show that our linearized function has the same merge tree as the original data. A greedy optimization scheme aligns the trees over time providing temporal continuity. This leads to a static 2D visualization with one temporal dimension, and all spatial dimensions compressed into one. We compare our method against other domain linearizations as well as feature-tracking approaches, and apply it to several real-world data sets.",Temporal Merge Tree Maps: A Topology-Based Static Visualization for Temporal Scalar Data,,DTr,2022
"This paper presents a design space of interaction techniques to engage with visualizations that are printed on paper and augmented through Augmented Reality. Paper sheets are widely used to deploy visualizations and provide a rich set of tangible affordances for interactions, such as touch, folding, tilting, or stacking. At the same time, augmented reality can dynamically update visualization content to provide commands such as pan, zoom, filter, or detail on demand. This paper is the first to provide a structured approach to mapping possible actions with the paper to interaction commands. This design space and the findings of a controlled user study have implications for future designs of augmented reality systems involving paper sheets and visualizations. Through workshops (N=20) and ideation, we identified 81 interactions that we classify in three dimensions: 1) commands that can be supported by an interaction, 2) the specific parameters provided by an (inter)action with paper, and 3) the number of paper sheets involved in an interaction. We tested user preference and viability of 11 of these interactions with a prototype implementation in a controlled study (N=12, HoloLens 2) and found that most of the interactions are intuitive and engaging to use. We summarized interactions (e.g., tilt to pan) that have strong affordance to complement “point” for data exploration, physical limitations and properties of paper as a medium, cases requiring redundancy and shortcuts, and other implications for design.",Exploring Interactions with Printed Data Visualizations in Augmented Reality,,R&I,2022
"Internet routing is largely dependent on Border Gateway Protocol (BGP). However, BGP does not have any inherent authentication or integrity mechanisms that help make it secure. Effective security is challenging or infeasible to implement due to high costs, policy employment in these distributed systems, and unique routing behavior. Visualization tools provide an attractive alternative in lieu of traditional security approaches. Several BGP security visualization tools have been developed as a stop-gap in the face of ever-present BGP attacks. Even though the target users, tasks, and domain remain largely consistent across such tools, many diverse visualization designs have been proposed. The purpose of this study is to provide an initial formalization of methods and visualization techniques for BGP cybersecurity analysis. Using PRISMA guidelines, we provide a systematic review and survey of 29 BGP visualization tools with their tasks, implementation techniques, and attacks and anomalies that they were intended for. We focused on BGP visualization tools as the main inclusion criteria to best capture the visualization techniques used in this domain while excluding solely algorithmic solutions and other detection tools that do not involve user interaction or interpretation. We take the unique approach of connecting (1) the actual BGP attacks and anomalies used to validate existing tools with (2) the techniques employed to detect them. In this way, we contribute an analysis of which techniques can be used for each attack type. Furthermore, we can see the evolution of visualization solutions in this domain as new attack types are discovered. This systematic review provides the groundwork for future designers and researchers building visualization tools for providing BGP cybersecurity, including an understanding of the state-of-the-art in this space and an analysis of what techniques are appropriate for each attack type.

"We present Rigel, an interactive system for rapid transformation of tabular data. Rigel implements a new declarative mapping approach that formulates the data transformation procedure as direct mappings from data to the row, column, and cell channels of the target table. To construct such mappings, Rigel allows users to directly drag data attributes from input data to these three channels and indirectly drag or type data values in a spreadsheet, and possible mappings that do not contradict these interactions are recommended to achieve efficient and straightforward data transformation. The recommended mappings are generated by enumerating and composing data variables based on the row, column, and cell channels, thereby revealing the possibility of alternative tabular forms and facilitating open-ended exploration in many data transformation scenarios, such as designing tables for presentation. In contrast to existing systems that transform data by composing operations (like transposing and pivoting), Rigel requires less prior knowledge on these operations, and constructing tables from the channels is more efficient and results in less ambiguity than generating operation sequences as done by the traditional by-example approaches. User study results demonstrated that Rigel is significantly less demanding in terms of time and interactions and suits more scenarios compared to the state-of-the-art by-example approach. A gallery of diverse transformation cases is also presented to show the potential of Rigel's expressiveness.",Rigel: Transforming Tabular Data By Declarative Mapping,,DTr,2022
"Conducting data analysis tasks rarely occur in isolation. Especially in intelligence analysis scenarios where different experts contribute knowledge to a shared understanding, members must communicate how insights develop to establish common ground among collaborators. The use of provenance to communicate analytic sensemaking carries promise by describing the interactions and summarizing the steps taken to reach insights. Yet, no universal guidelines exist for communicating provenance in different settings. Our work focuses on the presentation of provenance information and the resulting conclusions reached and strategies used by new analysts. In an open-ended, 30-minute, textual exploration scenario, we qualitatively compare how adding different types of provenance information (speciﬁcally data coverage and interaction history) affects analysts’ conﬁdence in conclusions developed, propensity to repeat work, ﬁltering of data, identiﬁcation of relevant information, and typical investigation strategies. We see that data coverage (i.e. what was interacted with) provides provenance information without limiting individual investigation freedom. On the other hand, while interaction history (i.e. when something was interacted with) does not signiﬁcantly encourage more mimicry, it does take more time to comfortably understand, as represented by less conﬁdent conclusions and less relevant information gathering behaviors. Our results contribute empirical data towards understanding how provenance summarizations can inﬂuence analysis behaviors.",The Influence of Visual Provenance Representations on Strategies in a Collaborative Hand-off Data Analysis Scenario,,A&D,2022
"Numerical simulation has become omnipresent in the automotive domain, posing new challenges such as high-dimensional parameter spaces and large as well as incomplete and multi-faceted data. In this design study, we show how interactive visual exploration and analysis of high-dimensional, spectral data from noise simulation can facilitate design improvements in the context of conflicting criteria. Here, we focus on structure-borne noise, i.e., noise from vibrating mechanical parts. Detecting problematic noise
 sources early in the design and production process is essential for reducing a product’s development costs and its time to market. In a close collaboration of visualization and automotive engineering, we designed a new, interactive approach to quickly identify and
 analyze critical noise sources, also contributing to an improved understanding of the analyzed system. Several carefully designed, interactive linked views enable the exploration of noises, vibrations, and harshness at multiple levels of detail, both in the frequency and spatial domain. This enables swift and smooth changes of perspective; selections in the frequency domain are immediately reflected in the spatial domain, and vice versa. Noise sources are quickly identified and shown in the context of their neighborhood, both in the frequency and spatial domain. We propose a novel drill-down view, especially tailored to noise data analysis. Split boxplots and synchronized 3D geometry views support comparison tasks. With this solution, engineers iterate over design optimizations much faster, while maintaining a good overview at each iteration. We evaluated the new approach in the automotive industry, studying noise
 simulation data for an internal combustion engine.",Interactive Visual Analysis of Structure-borne Noise Data,,App,2022
"The prevalence of inadequate SARS-COV-2 (COVID-19) responses may indicate a lack of trust in forecasts and risk communication. However, no work has empirically tested how multiple forecast visualization choices impact trust and task-based performance. The three studies presented in this paper (N = 1299) examine how visualization choices impact trust in COVID-19 mortality forecasts and how they influence performance in a trend prediction task. These studies focus on line charts populated with real-time COVID-19 data that varied the number and color encoding of the forecasts and the presence of best/worst-case forecasts. The studies reveal that trust in COVID-19 forecast visualizations initially increases with the number of forecasts and then plateaus after 6-9 forecasts. However, participants were most trusting of visualizations that showed less visual information, including a 95% confidence interval, single forecast, and grayscale encoded forecasts. Participants maintained high trust in intervals labeled with 50% and 25% and did not proportionally scale their trust to the indicated interval size. Despite the high trust, the 95% CI condition was the most likely to evoke predictions that did not correspond with the actual COVID-19 trend. Qualitative analysis of participants’ strategies confirmed that many participants trusted both the simplistic visualizations and those with numerous forecasts. This work provides practical guides for how COVID-19 forecast visualizations influence trust, including recommendations for identifying the range where forecasts balance trade-offs between trust and task-based performance.",Multiple Forecast Visualizations (MFVs): Trade-offs in Trust and Performance in Multiple COVID-19 Forecast Visualizations,,T&E,2022
"Recommendation algorithms have been leveraged in various ways within visualization systems to assist users as they perform of a range of information tasks. One common focus for these techniques has been the recommendation of content, rather than visual form, as a means to assist users in the identification of information that is relevant to their task context. A wide variety of techniques have been proposed to address this general problem, with a range of design choices in how these solutions surface relevant information to users. This paper reviews the state-of-the-art in how visualization systems surface recommended content to users during users' visual analysis; introduces a four-dimensional design space for visual content recommendation based on a characterization of prior work; and discusses key observations regarding common patterns and future research opportunities.",A Design Space for Surfacing Content Recommendations in Visual Analytic Platforms,,R&I,2022
"With deep learning (DL) outperforming conventional methods for different tasks, much effort has been devoted to utilizing DL in various domains. Researchers and developers in the traffic domain have also designed and improved DL models for forecasting tasks such as estimation of traffic speed and time of arrival. However, there exist many challenges in analyzing DL models due to the black-box property of DL models and complexity of traffic data (i.e., spatio-temporal dependencies). Collaborating with domain experts, we design a visual analytics system, AttnAnalyzer, that enables users to explore how DL models make predictions by allowing effective spatio-temporal dependency analysis. The system incorporates dynamic time warping (DTW) and Granger causality tests for computational spatio-temporal dependency analysis while providing map, table, line chart, and pixel views to assist user to perform dependency and model behavior analysis. For the evaluation, we present three case studies showing how AttnAnalyzer can effectively explore model behaviors and improve model performance in two different road networks. We also provide domain expert feedback.",A Visual Analytics System for Improving Attention-based Traffic Forecasting Models,,R&I,2022
"We propose a simple yet effective method for clustering finite elements to improve preprocessing times and rendering performance of unstructured volumetric grids without requiring auxiliary connectivity data. Rather than building bounding volume hierarchies (BVHs) over individual elements, we sort elements along with a Hilbert curve and aggregate neighboring elements together, improving BVH memory consumption by over an order of magnitude. Then to further reduce memory consumption, we cluster the mesh on the fly into sub-meshes with smaller indices using a series of efficient parallel mesh re-indexing operations. 
 These clusters are then passed to a highly optimized ray tracing API for point containment queries and ray-cluster intersection testing. Each cluster is assigned a maximum extinction value for adaptive sampling, which we rasterize into non-overlapping view-aligned bins allocated along the ray. These maximum extinction bins are then used to guide the placement of samples along the ray during visualization, reducing the number of samples required by multiple orders of magnitude (depending on the dataset), thereby improving overall visualization interactivity. Using our approach, we improve rendering performance over a competitive baseline on the NASA Mars Lander dataset from 6X (1 frame per second (fps) and 1.0M rays per second (rps) up to now 6fps and 12.4~M rps, now including volumetric shadows) while simultaneously reducing memory consumption by 3X (33GB down to 11GB) and avoiding any offline preprocessing steps, enabling high-quality interactive visualization on consumer graphics cards. Then by utilizing the full 48GB of an RTX 8000, we improve the performance of Lander by 17X (1fps up to 17fps, 1.0M rps up to 35.6M rps).",Quick Clusters: A GPU-Parallel Partitioning for Efficient Path Tracing of Unstructured Volumetric Grids,,DTr,2022
"Contrails are condensation trails generated from emitted particles by aircraft engines, which perturb Earth’s radiation budget. Simulation modeling is used to interpret the formation and development of contrails. These simulations are computationally intensive and rely on high-performance computing solutions, and the contrail structures are not well defined. We propose a visual computing system to assist in defining contrails and their characteristics, as well as in the analysis of parameters for computer-generated aircraft engine simulations. The back-end of our system leverages a contrail-formation criterion and clustering methods to detect contrails’ shape and evolution and identify similar simulation runs. The front-end system helps analyze contrails and their parameters across multiple simulation runs.

"Temporal (or time-evolving) networks are commonly used to model complex systems and the evolution of their components throughout time.
 Although these networks can be analyzed by different means, visual analytics stands out as an effective way for a pre-analysis before doing quantitative/statistical analyses to identify patterns, anomalies, and other behaviors in the data, thus leading to new insights and better decision-making.
 However, the large number of nodes, edges, and/or timestamps in many real-world networks may lead to polluted layouts that make the analysis inefficient or even infeasible.
 In this paper, we propose LargeNetVis, a web-based visual analytics system designed to assist in analyzing small and large temporal networks. It successfully achieves this goal by leveraging three taxonomies focused on network communities to guide the visual exploration process.
 The system is composed of four interactive visual components: the first (Taxonomy Matrix) presents a summary of the network characteristics, the second (Global View) gives an overview of the network evolution, the third (a node-link diagram) enables community- and node-level structural analysis, and the fourth (a Temporal Activity Map -- TAM) shows the community- and node-level activity under a temporal perspective.
 We demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of LargeNetVis through two usage scenarios and a user study with 14 participants.",LargeNetVis: visual exploration of large temporal networks based on community taxonomies,,A&D,2022
"Interpretation of genomics data is critically reliant on the application of a wide range of visualization tools. A large number of visualization techniques for genomics data and different analysis tasks pose a significant challenge for analysts: which visualization technique is most likely to help them generate insights into their data? Since genomics analysts typically have limited training in data visualization, their choices are often based on trial and error or guided by technical details, such as data formats that a specific tool can load. This approach prevents them from making effective visualization choices for the many combinations of data types and analysis questions they encounter in their work. Visualization recommendation systems assist non-experts in creating data visualization by recommending appropriate visualizations based on the data and task characteristics. However, existing visualization recommendation systems are not designed to handle domain-specific problems. To address these challenges, we designed GenoREC, a novel visualization recommendation system for genomics. GenoREC enables genomics analysts to select effective visualizations based on a description of their data and analysis tasks. Here, we present the recommendation model that uses a knowledge-based method for choosing appropriate visualizations and a web application that enables analysts to input their requirements, explore recommended visualizations, and export them for their usage. Furthermore, we present the results of two user studies demonstrating that GenoREC recommends visualizations that are both accepted by domain experts and suited to address the given genomics analysis problem.

"Multiple-view (MV) representations enabling multi-perspective exploration of large and complex data are often employed on 2D displays. The technique also shows great potential in addressing complex analytic tasks in immersive visualization. However, although useful, the design space of MV representations in immersive visualization lacks in deep exploration. In this paper, we propose a new perspective to this line of research, by examining the effects of view layout for MV representations on situated analytics. Specifically, we disentangle situated analytics in perspectives of situatedness regarding spatial relationship between visual representations and physical referents, and analytics regarding cross-view data analysis including filtering, refocusing, and connecting tasks. Through an in-depth analysis of existing layout paradigms, we summarize design trade-offs for achieving high situatedness and effective analytics simultaneously. We then distill a list of design requirements for a desired layout that balances situatedness and analytics, and develop a prototype system with an automatic layout adaptation method to fulfill the requirements. The method mainly includes a cylindrical paradigm for egocentric reference frame, and a force-directed method for proper view-view, view-user, and view-referent proximities and high view visibility. We conducted a formal user study that compares layouts by our method with linked and embedded layouts. Quantitative results show that participants finished filtering- and connecting-centered tasks significantly faster with our layouts, and user feedback confirms high usability of the prototype system.",Effects of View Layout On Situated Analytics for Multiple-View Representations in Immersive Visualization,,S&R,2022
"Multiclass contour visualization is often used to interpret complex data attributes in such fields as weather forecasting, computational fluid dynamics, and artificial intelligence. However, effective and accurate representations of underlying data patterns and correlations can be challenging in multiclass contour visualization, primarily due to the inevitable visual cluttering and occlusions when the number of classes is significant. To address this issue, visualization design must carefully choose design parameters to make visualization more comprehensible. With this goal in mind, we proposed a framework for multiclass contour visualization. The framework has two components: a set of four visualization design parameters, which are developed based on an extensive review of literature on contour visualization, and a declarative domain-specific language (DSL) for creating multiclass contour rendering, which enables a fast exploration of those design parameters. A task-oriented user study was conducted to assess how those design parameters affect users' interpretations of real-world data. The study results offered some suggestions on the value choices of design parameters in multiclass contour visualization.",A Framework for Multiclass Contour Visualization,,T&E,2022
"Data-centric AI has emerged as a new research area to systematically engineer the data to land AI models for real-world applications. As a core method for data-centric AI, data programming helps experts inject domain knowledge into data and label data at scale using carefully designed labeling functions (e.g., heuristic rules, logistics). Though data programming has shown great success in the NLP domain, it is challenging to program image data because of a) the challenge to describe images using visual vocabulary without human annotations and b) lacking efficient tools for data programming of images. We present Visual Concept Programming, a first-of-its-kind visual analytics approach of using visual concepts to program image data at scale while requiring a few human efforts. Our approach is built upon three unique components. It first uses a self-supervised learning approach to learn visual representation at the pixel level and extract a dictionary of visual concepts from images without using any human annotations. The visual concepts serve as building blocks of labeling functions for experts to inject their domain knowledge. We then design interactive visualizations to explore and understand visual concepts and compose labeling functions with concepts without writing code. Finally, with the composed labeling functions, users can label the image data at scale and use the labeled data to refine the pixel-wise visual representation and concept quality. We evaluate the learned pixel-wise visual representation for the downstream task of semantic segmentation to show the effectiveness and usefulness of our approach. In addition, we demonstrate how our approach tackles real-world problems of image retrieval for autonomous driving.",Visual Concept Programming: A Visual Analytics Approach to Injecting Human Intelligence at Scale,,A&D,2022
"We introduce relaxed dot plots as an improvement of nonlinear dot plots for unit visualization. Our plots produce more faithful data representations and reduce moiré effects. Their contour is based on a customized kernel frequency estimation to match the shape of the distribution of underlying data values. Previous nonlinear layouts introduce column-centric nonlinear scaling of dot diameters for visualization of high-dynamic-range data with high peaks. We provide a mathematical approach to convert that column-centric scaling to our smooth envelope shape. This formalism allows us to use linear, root, and logarithmic scaling to find ideal dot sizes. Our method iteratively relaxes the dot layout for more correct and aesthetically pleasing results. To achieve this, we modified Lloyd's algorithm with additional constraints and heuristics. We evaluate the layouts of relaxed dot plots against a previously existing nonlinear variant and show that our algorithm produces less error regarding the underlying data while establishing the blue noise property that works against moiré effects. Further, we analyze the readability of our relaxed plots in three crowd-sourced experiments. The results indicate that our proposed technique surpasses traditional dot plots.",Relaxed Dot Plots: Faithful Visualization of Samples and Their Distribution,,R&I,2022
"The IEEE VIS Conference (VIS) recently rebranded itself as a unified conference and officially positioned itself within the discipline of Data Science. Driven by this movement, we investigated (1) who contributed to VIS, and (2) where VIS stands in the scientific world. We examined the authors and fields of study of 3,240 VIS publications in the past 32 years based on data collected from OpenAlex and IEEE Xplore, among other sources. We also examined the citation flows from referenced papers (i.e., those referenced in VIS) to VIS, and from VIS to citing papers (i.e., those citing VIS). We found that VIS has been becoming increasingly popular and collaborative. The number of publications, of unique authors, and of participating countries have been steadily growing. Both cross-country collaborations, and collaborations between educational and non-educational affiliations, namely “cross-type collaborations'', are increasing. The dominance of the US is decreasing, and authors from China are now an important part of VIS. In terms of author affiliation types, VIS is increasingly dominated by authors from universities. We found that the topics, inspirations, and influences of VIS research is limited such that (1) VIS, and their referenced and citing papers largely fall into the Computer Science domain, and (2) citations flow mostly between the same set of subfields within Computer Science. Our citation analyses showed that award-winning VIS papers had higher citations.

"The visual analytics community has proposed several user modeling algorithms to capture and analyze users' interaction behavior in order to assist users in data exploration and insight generation. For example, some can detect exploration biases while others can predict data points that the user will interact with before that interaction occurs. Researchers believe this collection of algorithms can help create more intelligent visual analytics tools. However, the community lacks a rigorous evaluation and comparison of these existing techniques. As a result, there is limited guidance on which method to use and when. Our paper seeks to fill in this missing gap by comparing and ranking eight user modeling algorithms based on their performance on a diverse set of four user study datasets. We analyze exploration bias detection, data interaction prediction, and algorithmic complexity, among other measures. Based on our findings, we highlight open challenges and new directions for analyzing user interactions and visualization provenance.",A Unified Comparison of User Modeling Techniques for Predicting Data Interaction and Detecting Exploration Bias,,A&D,2022
"Due to their historical nature, humanistic data encompass multiple sources of uncertainty. While humanists are accustomed to handling such uncertainty with their established methods, they are cautious of visualizations that appear overly objective and fail to communicate this uncertainty. To design more trustworthy visualizations for humanistic research, therefore, a deeper understanding of its relation to uncertainty is needed. We systematically reviewed 126 publications from digital humanities literature that use visualization as part of their research process, and examined how uncertainty was handled and represented in their visualizations. Crossing these dimensions with the visualization type and use, we identified that uncertainty originated from multiple steps in the research process from the source artifacts to their datafication. We also noted how besides known uncertainty coping strategies, such as excluding data and evaluating its effects, humanists also embraced uncertainty as a separate dimension important to retain. By mapping how the visualizations encoded uncertainty, we identified four approaches that varied in terms of explicitness and customization. This work thus contributes with two empirical taxonomies of uncertainty and it’s corresponding coping strategies, as well as with the foundation of a research agenda for uncertainty visualization in the digital humanities. Our findings further the synergy among humanists and visualization researchers, and ultimately contribute to the development of more trustworthy, uncertainty-aware visualizations.",Communicating Uncertainty in Digital Humanities Visualization Research,,T&E,2022
"Understanding the behavior of software in execution is a key step in identifying and fixing performance issues. This is especially important in high performance computing contexts where even minor performance tweaks can translate into large savings in terms of computational resource use. To aid performance analysis, developers may collect an execution trace—a chronological log of program activity during execution. As traces represent the full history, developers can discover a wide array of possibly previously unknown performance issues, making them an important artifact for exploratory performance analysis. However, interactive trace visualization is difficult due to issues of data size and complexity of meaning. Traces represent nanosecond-level events across many parallel processes, meaning the collected data is often large and difficult to explore. The rise of asynchronous task parallel programming paradigms complicates the relation between events and their probable cause. To address these challenges, we conduct a continuing design study in collaboration with high performance computing researchers. We develop diverse and hierarchical ways to navigate and represent execution trace data in support of their trace analysis tasks. Through an iterative design process, we developed Traveler, an integrated visualization platform for task parallel traces. Traveler provides multiple linked interfaces to help navigate trace data from multiple contexts. We evaluate the utility of Traveler through feedback from users and a case study, finding that integrating multiple modes of navigation in our design supported performance analysis tasks and led to the discovery of previously unknown behavior in a distributed array library.",Traveler: Navigating Task Parallel Traces for Performance Analysis,,App,2022
"The language for expressing comparisons is often complex and nuanced, making supporting natural language-based visual comparison a non-trivial task. To better understand how people reason about comparisons in natural language, we explore a design space of utterances for comparing data entities. We identified different parameters of comparison utterances that indicate what is being compared (i.e., data variables and attributes) as well as how these parameters are specified (i.e., explicitly or implicitly). We conducted a user study with sixteen data visualization experts and non-experts to investigate how they designed visualizations for comparisons in our design space. Based on the rich set of visualization techniques observed, we extracted key design features from the visualizations and synthesized them into a subset of sixteen representative visualization designs. We then conducted a follow-up study to validate user preferences for the sixteen representative visualizations corresponding to utterances in our design space. Findings from these studies suggest guidelines and future directions for designing natural language interfaces and recommendation tools to better support natural language comparisons in visual analytics.",Comparison Conundrum and the Chamber of Visualizations: An Exploration of How Language Influences Visual Design,,T&E,2022
"Distances on merge trees facilitate visual comparison of collections of scalar fields. Two desirable properties for these distances to exhibit are 1) the ability to discern between scalar fields which other, less complex topological summaries cannot and 2) to still be robust to perturbations in the dataset. The combination of these two properties, known respectively as stability and discriminativity, has led to theoretical distances which are either thought to be or shown to be computationally complex and thus their implementations have been scarce. In order to design similarity measures on merge trees which are computationally feasible for more complex merge trees, many researchers have elected to loosen the restrictions on at least one of these two properties. The question still remains, however, if there are practical situations where trading these desirable properties is necessary. Here we construct a distance between merge trees which is designed to retain both discriminativity and stability. While our approach can be expensive for large merge trees, we illustrate its use in a setting where the number of nodes is small. This setting can be made more practical since we also provide a proof that persistence simplification increases the outputted distance by at most half of the simplified value. We demonstrate our distance measure on applications in shape comparison and on detection of periodicity in the von Kármán vortex street.",Computing a Stable Distance on Merge Trees,,DTr,2022
"We conduct a user study to quantify and compare user performance for a value comparison task using four bar chart designs, where the bars show the mean values of data loaded progressively and updated every second (progressive bar charts). Progressive visualization divides different stages of the visualization pipeline—data loading, processing, and visualization—into iterative animated steps to limit the latency when loading large amounts of data. An animated visualization appearing quickly, unfolding, and getting more accurate with time, enables users to make early decisions. However, intermediate mean estimates are computed only on partial data and may not have time to converge to the true means, potentially misleading users and resulting in incorrect decisions. To address this issue, we propose two new designs visualizing the history of values in progressive bar charts, in addition to the use of confidence intervals. We comparatively study four progressive bar chart designs: with/without confidence intervals, and using near-history representation with/without confidence intervals, on three realistic data distributions. We evaluate user performance based on the percentage of correct answers (accuracy), response time, and user confidence. Our results show that, overall, users can make early and accurate decisions with 92% accuracy using only 18% of the data, regardless of the design. We find that our proposed bar chart design with only near-history is comparable to bar charts with only confidence intervals in performance, and the qualitative feedback we received indicates a preference for designs with history.",Studying Early Decision Making with Progressive Bar Charts,,T&E,2022
"Storyline visualizations are a powerful way to compactly visualize how the relationships between people evolve over time. Real-world relationships often also involve space, for example the cities that two political rivals visited together or alone over the years. By default, Storyline visualizations only show implicitly geospatial co-occurrence between people (drawn as lines), by bringing their lines together. Even the few designs that do explicitly show geographic locations only do so in abstract ways (e.g. annotations) and do not communicate geospatial information, such as the direction or extent of their political campains. We introduce Geo-Storylines, a collection of visualisation designs that integrate geospatial context into Storyline visualizations, using different strategies for compositing time and space. Our contribution is twofold. First, we present the results of a sketching workshop with 11 participants, that we used to derive a design space for integrating maps into Storylines. Second, by analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of the potential designs of the design space in terms of legibility and ability to scale to multiple relationships, we extract the three most promising: Time Glyphs, Coordinated Views, and Map Glyphs. We compare these three techniques first in a controlled study with 18 participants, under five different geospatial tasks and two maps of different complexity. We additionally collected informal feedback about their usefulness from domain experts in data journalism. Our results indicate that, as expected, detailed performance depends on the task. Nevertheless, Coordinated Views remain a highly effective and preferred technique across the board.",Geo-Storylines: Integrating Maps into Storyline Visualizations,,T&E,2022
"Recent advancements in deep learning have shown the effectiveness of deep neural networks in several applications. The success of deep learning can be attributed to hours of parameter and architecture tuning by human experts. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) techniques aim to solve this problem by automating the search procedure for deep neural network architectures making it possible for non-experts to work with deep learning. Specifically, One-shot NAS techniques have recently gained popularity as they are known to reduce the search time for NAS techniques. One-Shot NAS works by training a large template network through parameter sharing which includes all the candidate neural networks. This is followed by applying a procedure to rank its components through evaluating the possible candidate architectures chosen randomly. However, as these search models become increasingly powerful and diverse, they become harder to understand. Consequently, even though the search results work well, it is hard to identify search biases and control the search progression, hence a need for explainability and human-in-the-loop One-Shot NAS. To alleviate these problems, we present NAS-Navigator, a visual analytics system aiming to solve three problems with One-Shot NAS; explainability, human-in-the-loop design, and performance improvements compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. NAS-Navigator gives full control of NAS back in the hands of the users while still keeping the perks of automated search, thus assisting non-expert users. Analysts can use their domain knowledge aided by cues from the interface to guide the search. Evaluation results confirm the performance of our improved One-Shot NAS algorithm is comparable to other state-of-the-art techniques. While adding visual analytics using NAS-Navigator shows further improvements in search time and performance.

SizePairs maximizes the visual quality and stability by optimizing the splitting orientation of each internal node and flipping leaf nodes, if necessary. We also present a comprehensive comparison of SizePairs against the state-of-the-art treemaps developed for visualizing time-dependent data.

"The overdraw problem of scatterplots seriously interferes with the visual tasks. Existing methods, such as data sampling, node dispersion, subspace mapping, and visual abstraction, cannot guarantee the correspondence and consistency between the data points that reflect the intrinsic original data distribution and the corresponding visual units that reveal the presented data distribution, thus failing to obtain an overlap-free scatterplot with unbiased and lossless data distribution. A dual space coupling model is proposed in this paper to represent the complex bilateral relationship between data space and visual space theoretically and analytically. Under the guidance of the model, an overlap-free scatterplot method is developed through integration of the following: a geometry-based data transformation algorithm, namely DistributionTranscriptor; an efficient spatial mutual exclusion guided view transformation algorithm, namely PolarPacking; an overlap-free oriented visual encoding configuration model and a radius adjustment tool, namely $f_{r_{draw}}$. Our method can ensure complete and accurate information transfer between the two spaces, maintaining consistency between the newly created scatterplot and the original data distribution on global and local features. Quantitative evaluation proves our remarkable progress on computational efficiency compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

"Interdisciplinary experimental science (e.g., medicinal chemistry) refers to the disciplines that integrate knowledge from different scientific backgrounds and involve experiments in the research process. Deciding ""in what direction to proceed"" is critical for the success of the research in such disciplines, since the time, money, and resource costs of the subsequent research steps depend largely on this decision. However, such a direction identification task is challenging in that researchers need to integrate information from large-scale, heterogeneous materials from all associated disciplines and summarize the related publications of which the core contributions are often showcased in diverse formats. The task also requires researchers to estimate the feasibility and potential in future experiments in the selected directions. In this work, we selected medicinal chemistry as a case and presented an interactive visual tool, MedChemLens, to assist medicinal chemists in choosing their intended directions of research. This task is also known as drug target (i.e., disease-linked proteins) selection. Given a candidate target name, MedChemLens automatically extracts the molecular features of drug compounds from chemical papers and clinical trial records, organizes them based on the drug structures, and interactively visualizes factors concerning subsequent experiments. We evaluated MedChemLens through a within-subjects study (N=16). Compared with the control condition (i.e., unrestricted online search without using our tool), participants who only used MedChemLens reported faster search, better-informed selections, higher confidence in their selections, and lower cognitive load.",MedChemLens: An Interactive Visual Tool to Support Direction Selection in Interdisciplinary Experimental Research of Medicinal Chemistry,,App,2022
"A time-frequency diagram is a commonly used visualization for observing the time-frequency distribution of radio signals and analyzing their time-varying patterns of communication states in radio monitoring and management. While it excels when performing short-term signal analyses, it becomes inadaptable for long-term signal analyses because it cannot adequately depict signal time-varying patterns in a large time span on a space-limited screen. This research thus presents an abstract signal time-frequency (ASTF) diagram to address this problem. In the diagram design, a visual abstraction method is proposed to visually encode signal communication state changes in time slices. A time segmentation algorithm is proposed to divide a large time span into time slices. Three new quantified metrics and a loss function are defined to ensure the preservation of important time-varying information in the time segmentation. An algorithm performance experiment and a user study are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the diagram for long-term signal analyses.",ASTF: Visual Abstractions of Time-Varying Patterns in Radio Signals,,App,2022
"We present sMolBoxes, a dataflow representation for the exploration and analysis of long molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. When MD simulations reach millions of snapshots, a frame-by-frame observation is not feasible anymore. Thus, biochemists rely to a large extent only on quantitative analysis of geometric and physico-chemical properties. However, the usage of abstract methods to study inherently spatial data hinders the exploration and poses a considerable workload. sMolBoxes link quantitative analysis of a user-defined set of properties with interactive 3D visualizations. They enable visual explanations of molecular behaviors, which lead to an efficient discovery of biochemically significant parts of the MD simulation. sMolBoxes follow a node-based model for flexible definition, combination, and immediate evaluation of properties to be investigated. Progressive analytics enable fluid switching between multiple properties, which facilitates hypothesis generation. Each sMolBox provides quick insight to an observed property or function, available in more detail in the bigBox View. The case studies illustrate that even with relatively few sMolBoxes, it is possible to express complex analytical tasks, and their use in exploratory analysis is perceived as more efficient than traditional scripting-based methods.",sMolBoxes: Dataflow Model for Molecular Dynamics Exploration,,App,2022
"When an analyst or scientist has a belief about how the world works, their thinking can be biased in favor of that belief. Therefore, one bedrock principle of science is to minimize that bias by testing the predictions of one’s belief against objective data. But interpreting visualized data is a complex perceptual and cognitive process. Through two crowdsourced experiments, we demonstrate that supposedly objective assessments of the strength of a correlational relationship can be influenced by how strongly a viewer believes in the existence of that relationship. Participants viewed scatterplots depicting a relationship between meaningful variable pairs (e.g., number of environmental regulations and air quality) and estimated their correlations. They also estimated the correlation of the same scatterplots labeled instead with generic 'X' and 'Y' axes. In a separate section, they also reported how strongly they believed there to be a correlation between the meaningful variable pairs. Participants estimated correlations more accurately when they viewed scatterplots labeled with generic axes compared to scatterplots labeled with meaningful variable pairs. Furthermore, when viewers believed that two variables should have a strong relationship, they overestimated correlations between those variables by an r-value of about 0.1. When they believed that the variables should be unrelated, they underestimated the correlations by an r-value of about 0.1. While data visualizations are typically thought to present objective truths to the viewer, these results suggest that existing personal beliefs can bias even objective statistical values people extract from data.",Seeing What You Believe or Believing What You See?

"Parallel coordinate plots (PCPs) have been widely used for high-dimensional (HD) data storytelling because they allow presenting a large number of dimensions without distortions. The axes ordering in PCP presents a particular story from the data based
 on the user perception of PCP polylines. Existing works focus on directly optimizing for PCP axes ordering based on some common analysis tasks like clustering, neighborhood, and correlation. However, direct optimization for PCP axes based on these common properties is restrictive because it does not account for multiple properties occurring between the axes, and for local properties that occur in small regions in the data. Also, many of these techniques do not support the human-in-the-loop (HIL) paradigm, which is crucial (i) for explainability and (ii) in cases where no single reordering scheme fits the users’ goals. To alleviate these problems, we
 present PC-Expo, a real-time visual analytics framework for all-in-one PCP line pattern detection, and axes reordering. We studied the connection of line patterns in PCPs with different data analysis tasks and datasets. PC-Expo expands prior work on PCP axes
 reordering by developing real-time, local detection schemes for the 12 most common analysis tasks (properties). Users can choose the story they want to present with PCPs by optimizing directly over their choice of properties. These properties can be ranked, or
 combined using individual weights, creating a custom optimization scheme for axes reordering. Users can control the granularity at which they want to work with their detection scheme in the data, allowing exploration of local regions. PC-Expo also supports HIL axes reordering via local-property visualization, which shows the regions of granular activity for every axis pair. Local-property visualization is helpful for PCP axes reordering based on multiple properties, when no single reordering scheme fits the user goals. A comprehensive evaluation done with real users and diverse datasets confirms the efficacy of PC-Expo in data storytelling with PCPs.",PC-Expo: A Metrics-Based Interactive Axes Reordering Method for Parallel Coordinate Displays,,A&D,2022
"Interaction is an important channel to offer users insights in interactive visualization systems. However, which interaction to operate and which part of data to explore are hard questions for public users facing a multi-view visualization for the first time. Making these decisions largely relies on professional experience and analytic abilities, which is a huge challenge for non-professionals. To solve the problem, we propose a method aiming to provide diverse, insightful, and real-time interaction recommendations for novice users. Building on the Long-Short Term Memory Model (LSTM) structure, our model captures users' interactions and visual states and encodes them in numerical vectors to make further recommendations. Through an illustrative example of a visualization system about Chinese poets in the museum scenario, the model is proven to be workable in systems with multi-views and multiple interaction types. A further user study demonstrates the method's capability to help public users conduct more insightful and diverse interactive explorations and gain more accurate data insights.",Diverse Interaction Recommendation for Public Users Exploring Multi-view Visualization using Deep Learning,,R&I,2022
"Reference-based cell-type annotation can significantly reduce time and effort in single-cell analysis by transferring labels from a previously-annotated dataset to a new dataset. However, label transfer by end-to-end computational methods is challenging due to the entanglement of technical (e.g., from different sequencing batches or techniques) and biological (e.g., from different cellular microenvironments) variations, only the first of which must be removed. To address this issue, we propose Polyphony, an interactive transfer learning (ITL) framework, to complement biologists' knowledge with advanced computational methods. Polyphony is motivated and guided by domain experts' needs for a controllable, interactive, and algorithm-assisted annotation process, identified through interviews with seven biologists. We introduce anchors, i.e., analogous cell populations across datasets, as a paradigm to explain the computational process and collect user feedback for model improvement. We further design a set of visualizations and interactions to empower users to add, delete, or modify anchors, resulting in refined cell type annotations. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through quantitative experiments, two hypothetical use cases, and interviews with two biologists. The results show that our anchor-based ITL method takes advantage of both human and machine intelligence in annotating massive single-cell datasets.",Polyphony: an Interactive Transfer Learning Framework for Single-Cell Data Analysis,,A&D,2022
"Law enforcement and domain experts can detect human trafficking (HT) in online escort websites by analyzing suspicious clusters of connected ads. How can we explain clustering results intuitively and interactively, visualizing potential evidence for experts to analyze?
 We present TrafficVis, the first interface for cluster-level HT detection and labeling. Developed through months of participatory design with domain experts, TrafficVis provides coordinated views in conjunction with carefully chosen backend algorithms to effectively show spatio-temporal and text patterns to a wide variety of anti-HT stakeholders. We build upon state-of-the-art text clustering algorithms by incorporating shared metadata as a signal of connected and possibly suspicious activity, then visualize the results. Domain experts can use TrafficVis to label clusters as HT, or other, suspicious, but non-HT activity such as spam and scam, quickly creating labeled datasets to enable further HT research.
 Through domain expert feedback and a usage scenario, we demonstrate TrafficVis's efficacy. The feedback was overwhelmingly positive, with repeated high praises for the usability and explainability of our tool, the latter being vital for indicting possible criminals.",TRAFFICVIS: Visualizing Organized Activity and Spatio-Temporal Patterns for Detecting and Labeling Human Trafficking,,App,2022
"We propose VDL-Surrogate, a view-dependent neural-network-latent-based surrogate model for parameter space exploration of ensemble simulations that allows high-resolution visualizations and user-specified visual mappings. Surrogate-enabled parameter space exploration allows domain scientists to preview simulation results without having to run a large number of computationally costly simulations. Limited by computational resources, however, existing surrogate models may not produce previews with sufficient resolution for visualization and analysis. To improve the efficient use of computational resources and support high-resolution exploration, we perform ray casting from different viewpoints to collect samples and produce compact latent representations. This latent encoding process reduces the cost of surrogate model training while maintaining the output quality. In the model training stage, we select viewpoints to cover the whole viewing sphere and train corresponding VDL-Surrogate models for the selected viewpoints. In the model inference stage, we predict the latent representations at previously selected viewpoints and decode the latent representations to data space. For any given viewpoint, we make interpolations over decoded data at selected viewpoints and generate visualizations with user-specified visual mappings. We show the effectiveness and efficiency of VDL-Surrogate in cosmological and ocean simulations with quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

"Understanding one’s audience is foundational to creating high impact visualization designs. However, individual differences and cognitive abilities influence interactions with information visualization. Different user needs and abilities suggest that an individual’s background could influence cognitive performance and interactions with visuals in a systematic way. This study builds on current research in domain-specific visualization and cognition to address if domain and spatial visualization ability combine to affect performance on information visualization tasks. We measure spatial visualization and visual task performance between those with tertiary education and professional profile in business, law & political science, and math & computer science. We conducted an online study with 90 participants using an established psychometric test to assess spatial visualization ability, and bar chart layouts rotated along Cartesian and polar coordinates to assess performance on spatially rotated data. Accuracy and response times varied with domain across chart types and task difficulty. We found that accuracy and time correlate with spatial visualization level, and education in math & computer science can indicate higher spatial visualization. Additionally, we found that motivational differences between domains could contribute to increased levels of accuracy. Our findings indicate discipline not only affects user needs and interactions with data visualization, but also cognitive traits. Our results can advance inclusive practices in visualization design and add to knowledge in domain-specific visual research that can empower designers across disciplines to create effective visualizations.",Measuring Effects of Spatial Visualization and Domain on Visualization Task Performance: A Comparative Study,,T&E,2022
"Data workers usually seek to understand the semantics of data wrangling scripts in various scenarios, such as code debugging, reusing, and maintaining. However, the understanding is challenging for novice data workers due to the variety of programming languages, functions, and parameters. Based on the observation that differences between input and output tables highly relate to the type of data transformation, we outline a design space including 103 characteristics to describe table differences. Then, we develop COMANTICS, a three-step pipeline that automatically detects the semantics of data transformation scripts. The first step focuses on the detection of table differences for each line of wrangling code. Second, we incorporate a characteristic-based component and a Siamese convolutional neural network-based component for the detection of transformation types. Third, we derive the parameters of each data transformation by employing a ""slot filling"" strategy. We design experiments to evaluate the performance of COMANTICS. Further, we assess its flexibility using three example applications in different domains.",Revealing the Semantics of Data Wrangling Scripts With COMANTICS,,DTr,2022
"Visualization and analysis of multivariate data and their uncertainty are top research challenges in data visualization. Constructing fiber surfaces is a popular technique for multivariate data visualization that generalizes the idea of level-set visualization for univariate data to multivariate data. In this paper, we present a statistical framework to quantify positional probabilities of fibers extracted from uncertain bivariate fields. Specifically, we extend the state-of-the-art Gaussian models of uncertainty for bivariate data to other parametric distributions (e.g., uniform and Epanechnikov) and more general nonparametric probability distributions (e.g., histograms and kernel density estimation) and derive corresponding spatial probabilities of fibers. In our proposed framework, we leverage Green’s theorem for closed-form computation of fiber probabilities when bivariate data are assumed to have independent parametric and nonparametric noise. Additionally, we present a nonparametric approach combined with numerical integration to study the positional probability of fibers when bivariate data are assumed to have correlated noise. For uncertainty analysis, we visualize the derived probability volumes for fibers via volume rendering and extracting level sets based on probability thresholds. We present the utility of our proposed techniques via experiments on synthetic and simulation datasets.",Fiber Uncertainty Visualization for Bivariate Data With Parametric and Nonparametric Noise Models,,DTr,2022
"Augmented sports videos, which combine visualizations and video effects to present data in actual scenes, can communicate insights engagingly and thus have been increasingly popular for sports enthusiasts around the world. Yet, creating augmented sports videos remains a challenging task, requiring considerable time and video editing skills. On the other hand, sports insights are often communicated using natural languages, such as in commentaries, oral presentations, and articles, but usually lack visual cues. Thus, this work aims to facilitate the creation of augmented sports videos by enabling analysts to directly create visualizations embedded in videos using insights expressed in natural language. To achieve this goal, we proposed a three-step approach – 1) detecting visualizable entities in the text, 2) mapping these entities into visualizations, and 3) scheduling these visualizations to play with the video – and analyzed 155 sports video clips and the accompanying commentaries for accomplishing these steps. Informed by our analysis, we have designed and implemented Sporthesia, a proof-of-concept system that takes racket-based sports videos and textual commentaries as the input and outputs augmented videos. We demonstrate Sporthesia’s applicability in two exemplar scenarios, i.e., authoring augmented sports videos using text and augmenting historical sports videos based on auditory comments. A technical evaluation shows that Sporthesia achieves high accuracy (F1-score of 0.9) in detecting visualizable entities in the text. An expert evaluation with eight sports analysts suggests high utility, effectiveness, and satisfaction with our language-driven authoring method and provides insights for future improvement and opportunities.",Sporthesia: Augmenting Sports Videos Using Natural Language,,S&R,2022
"Interaction is increasingly integrating into data stories to support data exploration and explanation. Interaction can also be combined with the narrative device, breaking the fourth wall (BTFW), to build a deeper connection between readers and data stories. BTFW interaction directly addresses readers by requiring their input. Such user input is then integrated into the narrative or visuals of data stories to encourage readers to inspect the stories more closely. In this work, we explore the design patterns of BTFW interaction commonly used in data stories. Six design patterns were identified through the analysis of 58 high-quality data stories collected from a range of online sources. Specifically, the data stories were categorized using a coding framework, including the input of BTFW interaction provided by readers and the output of BTFW interaction generated by data stories to respond to the input. To explore the benefits as well as concerns of using BTFW interaction, we conducted a three-session user study including the reading, interview, and recall sessions. The results of our user study suggested that BTFW interaction has a positive impact on self-story connection, user engagement, and information recall. We also discussed design implications to address the possible negative effects on the interactivity-comprehensibility balance, information privacy, and the learning curve of interaction brought by BTFW interaction.",Breaking the Fourth Wall of Data Stories through Interaction,,R&I,2022
"Frequency-based decomposition of time series data is used in many visualization applications. Most of these decomposition methods (such as Fourier transform or singular spectrum analysis) only provide interaction via pre- and post-processing, but no means to influence the core algorithm. A method that also belongs to this class is Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a spectral decomposition method that extracts spatio-temporal patterns from data. In this paper, we incorporate frequency-based constraints into DMD for an adaptive decomposition that leads to user-controllable visualizations, allowing analysts to include their knowledge into the process. To accomplish this, we derive an equivalent reformulation of DMD that implicitly provides access to the eigenvalues (and therefore to the frequencies) identified by DMD. By utilizing a constrained minimization problem customized to DMD, we can guarantee the existence of desired frequencies by minimal changes to DMD. We complement this core approach by additional techniques for constrained DMD to facilitate explorative visualization and investigation of time series data. With several examples, we demonstrate the usefulness of constrained DMD and compare it to conventional frequency-based decomposition methods.",Constrained Dynamic Mode Decomposition,,DTr,2022
"Immersive environments offer new possibilities for exploring three-dimensional volumetric or abstract data. However, typical mid-air interaction offers little guidance to the user in interacting with the resulting visuals. Previous work has explored the use of haptic controls to give users tangible affordances for interacting with the data, but these controls have either: been limited in their range and resolution; were spatially fixed; or required users to manually align them with the data space. We explore the use of a robot arm with hand tracking to align tangible controls under the user’s fingers as they reach out to interact with data affordances. We begin with a study evaluating the effectiveness of a robot-extended slider control compared to a large fixed physical slider and a purely virtual mid-air slider. We find that the robot slider has similar accuracy to the physical slider but is significantly more accurate than mid-air interaction. Further, the robot slider can be arbitrarily reoriented, opening up many new possibilities for tangible haptic interaction with immersive visualisations. We demonstrate these possibilities through three use-cases: selection in a time-series chart; interactive slicing of CT scans; and finally exploration of a scatter plot depicting time-varying socio-economic data.",RoboHapalytics: A Robot Assisted Haptic Controller for Immersive Analytics,,S&R,2022
"Visual perception is a key component of data visualization. Much prior empirical work uses eye movement as a proxy to understand human visual perception. Diverse apparatus and techniques have been proposed to collect eye movements, but there is still no optimal approach. In this paper, we review 30 prior works for collecting eye movements based on three axes: (1) the tracker technology used to measure eye movements; (2) the image stimulus shown to participants; and (3) the collection methodology used to gather the data. Based on this taxonomy, we employ a webcam-based eyetracking approach using task-specific visualizations as the stimulus. The low technology requirement means that virtually anyone can participate, thus enabling us to collect data at large scale using crowdsourcing: approximately 12,000 samples in total. Choosing visualization images as stimulus means that the eye movements will be specific to perceptual tasks associated with visualization. We use these data to propose a SCANNER DEEPLY, a virtual eyetracker model that, given an image of a visualization, generates a gaze heatmap for that image. We employ a computationally efficient, yet powerful convolutional neural network for our model. We compare the results of our work with results from the DVS model and a neural network trained on the Salicon dataset. The analysis of our gaze patterns enables us to understand how users grasp the structure of visualized data. We also make our stimulus dataset of visualization images available as part of this paper’s contribution.",A Scanner Deeply: Predicting Gaze Heatmaps on Visualizations Using Crowdsourced Eye Movement Data,,T&E,2022
"Large-scale scientific data, such as weather and climate simulations, often comprise a large number of attributes for each data sample, like temperature, pressure, humidity, and many more. Interactive visualization and analysis require filtering according to any desired combination of attributes, in particular logical AND operations, which is challenging for large data and many attributes. Many general data structures for this problem are built for and scale with a fixed number of attributes, and scalability of joint queries with arbitrary attribute subsets remains a significant problem. We propose a flexible probabilistic framework for multivariate range queries that decouples all attribute dimensions via projection, allowing any subset of attributes to be queried with full efficiency. Moreover, our approach is output-sensitive, mainly scaling with the cardinality of the query result rather than with the input data size. This is particularly important for joint attribute queries, where the query output is usually much smaller than the whole data set. Additionally, our approach can split query evaluation between user interaction and rendering, achieving much better scalability for interactive visualization than the previous state of the art. Furthermore, even when a multi-resolution strategy is used for visualization, queries are jointly evaluated at the finest data granularity, because our framework does not limit query accuracy to a fixed spatial subdivision.",Multivariate Probabilistic Range Queries for Scalable Interactive 3D Visualization,,S&R,2022
"The trouble with data is that it frequently provides only an imperfect representation of a phenomenon of interest. Experts who are familiar with their datasets will often make implicit, mental corrections when analyzing a dataset, or will be cautious not to be overly confident about their findings if caveats are present. However, personal knowledge about the caveats of a dataset is typically not incorporated in a structured way, which is problematic if others who lack that knowledge interpret the data. In this work, we define such analysts' knowledge about datasets as data hunches. We differentiate data hunches from uncertainty and discuss types of hunches. We then explore ways of recording data hunches, and, based on a prototypical design, develop recommendations for designing visualizations that support data hunches. We conclude by discussing various challenges associated with data hunches, including the potential for harm and challenges for trust and privacy. We envision that data hunches will empower analysts to externalize their knowledge, facilitate collaboration and communication, and support the ability to learn from others' data hunches.",Data Hunches: Incorporating Personal Knowledge into Visualizations,,T&E,2022
"A key challenge to visualization authoring is the process of getting familiar with the complex user interfaces of authoring tools. Natural Language Interface (NLI) presents promising benefits due to its learnability and usability. However, supporting NLIs for authoring tools requires expertise in natural language processing, while existing NLIs are mostly designed for visual analytic workflow. In this paper, we propose an authoring-oriented NLI pipeline by introducing a structured representation of users’ visualization editing intents, called editing actions, based on a formative study and an extensive survey on visualization construction tools. The editing actions are executable, and thus decouple natural language interpretation and visualization applications as an intermediate layer. We implement a deep learning-based NL interpreter to translate NL utterances into editing actions. The interpreter is reusable and extensible across authoring tools. The authoring tools only need to map the editing actions into tool-specific operations. To illustrate the usages of the NL interpreter, we implement an Excel chart editor and a proof-of-concept authoring tool, VisTalk. We conduct a user study with VisTalk to understand the usage patterns of NL-based authoring systems. Finally, we discuss observations on how users author charts with natural language, as well as implications for future research.",Towards Natural Language-Based Visualization Authoring,,R&I,2022
"Traditional deep learning interpretability methods which are suitable for model users cannot explain network behaviors at the global level and are inflexible at providing fine-grained explanations. As a solution, concept-based explanations are gaining attention due to their human intuitiveness and their flexibility to describe both global and local model behaviors. Concepts are groups of similarly meaningful pixels that express a notion, embedded within the network’s latent space and have commonly been hand-generated, but have recently been discovered by automated approaches. Unfortunately, the magnitude and diversity of discovered concepts makes it difficult to navigate and make sense of the concept space. Visual analytics can serve a valuable role in bridging these gaps by enabling structured navigation and exploration of the concept space to provide concept-based insights of model behavior to users. To this end, we design, develop, and validate ConceptExplainer, a visual analytics system that enables people to interactively probe and explore the concept space to explain model behavior at the instance/class/global level. The system was developed via iterative prototyping to address a number of design challenges that model users face in interpreting the behavior of deep learning models. Via a rigorous user study, we validate how ConceptExplainer supports these challenges. Likewise, we conduct a series of usage scenarios to demonstrate how the system supports the interactive analysis of model behavior across a variety of tasks and explanation granularities, such as identifying concepts that are important to classification, identifying bias in training data, and understanding how concepts can be shared across diverse and seemingly dissimilar classes.",ConceptExplainer: Interactive Explanation for Deep Neural Networks from a Concept Perspective,,App,2022
"Pictorial visualizations portray data with figurative messages and approximate the audience to the visualization. Previous research on pictorial visualizations has developed authoring tools or generation systems, but their methods are restricted to specific visualization types and templates. Instead, we propose to augment pictorial visualization authoring with visual style transfer, enabling a more extensible approach to visualization design. To explore this, our work presents Vistylist, a design support tool that disentangles the visual style of a source pictorial visualization from its content and transfers the visual style to one or more intended pictorial visualizations. We evaluated Vistylist through a survey of example pictorial visualizations, a controlled user study, and a series of expert interviews. The results of our evaluation indicated that Vistylist is useful for creating expressive and faithful pictorial visualizations.",Supporting Expressive and Faithful Pictorial Visualization Design with Visual Style Transfer,,R&I,2022

 in KiriPhys, we conducted a qualitative study in which 12 participants interacted with four KiriPhys examples. Our observations of how
 people interact with, understand, and respond to KiriPhys suggest that KiriPhys: 1) provides new opportunities for interactive, layered

"Improving the efficiency of coal-fired power plants has numerous benefits. The control strategy is one of the major factors affecting such efficiency. However, due to the complex and dynamic environment inside the power plants, it is hard to extract and evaluate control strategies and their cascading impact across massive sensors. Existing manual and data-driven approaches cannot well support the analysis of control strategies because these approaches are time-consuming and do not scale with the complexity of the power plant systems. Three challenges were identified: a) interactive extraction of control strategies from large-scale dynamic sensor data, b) intuitive visual representation of cascading impact among the sensors in a complex power plant system, and c) time-lag-aware analysis of the impact of control strategies on electricity generation efficiency. By collaborating with energy domain experts, we addressed these challenges with ECoalVis, a novel interactive system for experts to visually analyze the control strategies of coal-fired power plants extracted from historical sensor data. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated with two usage scenarios on a real-world historical dataset and received positive feedback from experts.",ECoalVis: Visual Analysis of Control Strategies in Coal-fired Power Plants,,A&D,2022

However, there is little understanding of how visualization designers use examples, and how computational tools may support such activities. In this paper, we contribute an exploratory study of current practices in incorporating visualization examples. We conducted semi-structured interviews with 15 university students and 15 professional designers. Our analysis focus on two core design activities: searching for examples and utilizing examples. We characterize observed strategies and tools for performing these activities, as well as major challenges that hinder designers’ current workflows. In addition, we identify themes that cut across these two activities: criteria for determining example usefulness, curation practices, and design fixation. Given our findings, we discuss the implications for visualization design and authoring tools and highlight critical areas for future research.",Understanding how Designers Find and Use Data Visualization Examples,,T&E,2022
"Due to their pedagogical advantages, large final projects in information visualization courses have become standard practice. Students take on a client--real or simulated--a dataset, and a vague set of goals to create a complete visualization or visual analytics product. Unfortunately, many projects suffer from ambiguous goals, over or under-constrained client expectations, and data constraints that have students spending their time on non-visualization problems (e.g., data cleaning). These are important skills, but are often secondary course objectives, and unforeseen problems can majorly hinder students. We created an alternative for our information visualization course: Roboviz, a real-time game for students to play by building a visualization-focused interface. By designing the game mechanics around four different data types, the project allows students to create a wide array of interactive visualizations. Student teams play against their classmates with the objective to collect the most (good) robots. The flexibility of the strategies encourages variability, a range of approaches, and solving wicked design constraints. We describe the construction of this game and report on student projects over two years. We further show how the game mechanics can be extended or adapted to other game-based projects.",Roboviz: A Game-Centered Project for Information Visualization Education,,T&E,2022
"New highly-multiplexed imaging technologies have enabled the study of tissues in unprecedented detail. These methods are increasingly being applied to understand how cancer cells and immune response change during tumor development, progression, and metastasis, as well as following treatment. Yet, existing analysis approaches focus on investigating small tissue samples on a per-cell basis, not taking into account the spatial proximity of cells, which indicates cell-cell interaction and specific biological processes in the larger cancer microenvironment. We present Visinity, a scalable visual analytics system to analyze cell interaction patterns across cohorts of whole-slide multiplexed tissue images. Our approach is based on a fast regional neighborhood computation, leveraging unsupervised learning to quantify, compare, and group cells by their surrounding cellular neighborhood. These neighborhoods can be visually analyzed in an exploratory and confirmatory workflow. Users can explore spatial patterns present across tissues through a scalable image viewer and coordinated views highlighting the neighborhood composition and spatial arrangements of cells. To verify or refine existing hypotheses, users can query for specific patterns to determine their presence and statistical significance. Findings can be interactively annotated, ranked, and compared in the form of small multiples. In two case studies with biomedical experts, we demonstrate that Visinity can identify common biological processes within a human tonsil and uncover novel white-blood cell networks and immune-tumor interactions.",Visinity: Visual Spatial Neighborhood Analysis for Multiplexed Tissue Imaging Data,,App,2022
"Whether AI explanations can help users achieve specific tasks efficiently (i.e., usable explanations) is significantly influenced by their visual presentation. While many techniques exist to generate explanations, it remains unclear how to select and visually present AI explanations based on the characteristics of domain users. This paper aims to understand this question through a multidisciplinary design study for a specific problem: explaining graph neural network (GNN) predictions to domain experts in drug repurposing, i.e., reuse of existing drugs for new diseases. Building on the nested design model of visualization, we incorporate XAI design considerations from a literature review and from our collaborators’ feedback into the design process. Specifically, we discuss XAI-related design considerations for usable visual explanations at each design layer: target user, usage context, domain explanation, and XAI goal at the domain layer; format, granularity, and operation of explanations at the abstraction layer; encodings and interactions at the visualization layer; and XAI and rendering algorithm at the algorithm layer. We present how the extended nested model motivates and informs the design of DrugExplorer, an XAI tool for drug repurposing. Based on our domain characterization, DrugExplorer provides path-based explanations and presents them both as individual paths and meta-paths for two key XAI operations, why and what else. DrugExplorer offers a novel visualization design called MetaMatrix with a set of interactions to help domain users organize and compare explanation paths at different levels of granularity to generate domain meaningful insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the selected visual presentation and DrugExplorer as a whole via a usage scenario, a user study, and expert interviews. From these evaluations, we derive insightful observations and reflections that can inform the design of XAI visualizations for other scientific applications.",Extending the Nested Model for User-Centric XAI: A Design Study on GNN-based Drug Repurposing,,App,2022
"Over the past few decades, a large number of graph layout techniques have been proposed for visualizing graphs from various domains. In this paper, we present a general framework, Taurus, for unifying popular techniques such as the spring-electrical model, stress model, and maxent-stress model. It is based on a unified force representation, which formulates most existing techniques as a combination of quotient-based forces that combine power functions of graph-theoretical and Euclidean distances. This representation enables us to compare the strengths and weaknesses of existing techniques, while facilitating the development of new methods. Based on this, we propose a new balanced stress model (BSM) that is able to layout graphs in superior quality. In addition, we introduce a universal augmented stochastic gradient descent (SGD) optimizer that efficiently finds proper solutions for all layout techniques. To demonstrate the power of our framework, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of existing techniques on a large number of synthetic and real graphs. We release an open-source package, which facilitates easy comparison of different graph layout methods for any graph input as well as effectively creating customized graph layout techniques.",Taurus: Towards A Unified Force Representation and Universal Solver for Graph Layout,,S&R,2022
"With the rise of AI, algorithms have become better at learning underlying patterns from the training data including ingrained social biases based on gender, race, etc. Deployment of such algorithms to domains such as hiring, healthcare, law enforcement, etc. has raised serious concerns about fairness, accountability, trust and interpretability in machine learning algorithms. To alleviate this problem, we propose D-BIAS, a visual interactive tool that embodies human-in-the-loop AI approach for auditing and mitigating social biases from tabular datasets. It uses a graphical causal model to represent causal relationships among different features in the dataset and as a medium to inject domain knowledge. A user can detect the presence of bias against a group, say females, or a subgroup, say black females, by identifying unfair causal relationships in the causal network and using an array of fairness metrics. Thereafter, the user can mitigate bias by refining the causal model and acting on the unfair causal edges. For each interaction, say weakening/deleting a biased causal edge, the system uses a novel method to simulate a new (debiased) dataset based on the current causal model while ensuring a minimal change from the original dataset. Users can visually assess the impact of their interactions on different fairness metrics, utility metrics, data distortion, and the underlying data distribution. Once satisfied, they can download the debiased dataset and use it for any downstream application for fairer predictions. We evaluate D-BIAS by conducting experiments on 3 datasets and also a formal user study. We found that D-BIAS helps reduce bias significantly compared to the baseline debiasing approach across different fairness metrics while incurring little data distortion and a small loss in utility. Moreover, our human-in-the-loop based approach significantly outperforms an automated approach on trust, interpretability and accountability.",D-BIAS: A Causality-Based Human-in-the-Loop System for Tackling Algorithmic Bias,,A&D,2022
"Recent technological innovations have led to an increase in the availability of 3D urban data, such as shadow, noise, solar potential, and earthquake simulations. These spatiotemporal datasets create opportunities for new visualizations to engage experts from different domains to study the dynamic behavior of urban spaces in this under explored dimension. However, designing 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations is challenging, as it requires visual strategies to support analysis of time-varying data referent to the city geometry. Although different visual strategies have been used in 3D urban visual analytics, the question of how effective these visual designs are at supporting spatiotemporal analysis on building surfaces remains open. To investigate this, in this paper we first contribute a series of analytical tasks elicited after interviews with practitioners from three urban domains. We also contribute a quantitative user study comparing the effectiveness of four representative visual designs used to visualize 3D spatiotemporal urban data: spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition, linked view, and embedded view. Participants performed a series of tasks that required them to identify extreme values on building surfaces over time. Tasks varied in granularity for both space and time dimensions. Our results demonstrate that participants were more accurate using plot-based visualizations (linked view, embedded view) but faster using color-coded visualizations (spatial juxtaposition, temporal juxtaposition). Our results also show that, with increasing task complexity, plot-based visualizations perform better in preserving efficiency (time, accuracy) compared to color-coded visualizations. Based on our findings, we present a set of takeaways with design recommendations for 3D spatiotemporal urban visualizations for researchers and practitioners. Lastly, we report on a series of interviews with four practitioners, and their feedback and suggestions for further work on the visualizations to support 3D spatiotemporal urban data analysis.",A Comparison of Spatiotemporal Visualizations for 3D Urban Analytics,,T&E,2022
"Ergonomic risk assessment is now, due to an increased awareness, carried out more often than in the past. The conventional risk assessment evaluation, based on expert-assisted observation of the workplaces and manually filling in score tables, is still predominant.

In this paper we introduce ErgoExplorer, a system for the interactive visual analysis of risk assessment data. In contrast to the current practice, we focus on data that span across multiple actions and multiple workers while keeping all contextual information. Data is automatically extracted from video streams. Based on carefully investigated analysis tasks, we introduce new views and their corresponding interactions. These views also incorporate domain-specific score tables to guarantee an easy adoption by domain experts. All views are integrated into ErgoExplorer, which relies on coordinated multiple views to facilitate analysis through interaction.
 ErgoExplorer makes it possible for the first time to examine complex relationships between risk assessments of individual body parts over long sessions that span multiple operations. The newly introduced approach supports analysis and exploration at several levels of detail, ranging from a general overview, down to inspecting individual frames in the video stream, if necessary. We illustrate the usefulness of the newly proposed approach applying it to several datasets.",ErgoExplorer: Interactive Ergonomic Risk Assessment from Video Collections,,App,2022
"In history research, cohort analysis seeks to identify social structures and figure mobilities by studying the group-based behavior of historical figures. Prior works mainly employ automatic data mining approaches, lacking effective visual explanation. In this paper, we present CohortVA, an interactive visual analytic approach that enables historians to incorporate expertise and insight into the iterative exploration process. The kernel of CohortVA is a novel identification model that generates candidate cohorts and constructs cohort features by means of pre-built knowledge graphs constructed from large-scale history databases. We propose a set of coordinated views to illustrate identified cohorts and features coupled with historical events and figure profiles. Two case studies and interviews with historians demonstrate that CohortVA can greatly enhance the capabilities of cohort identifications, figure authentications, and hypothesis generation.",CohortVA: A Visual Analytic System for Interactive Exploration of Cohorts based on Historical Data,,App,2022
"In this paper, we present DendroMap, a novel approach to interactively exploring large-scale image datasets for machine learning (ML). ML practitioners often explore image datasets by generating a grid of images or projecting high-dimensional representations of images into 2-D using dimensionality reduction techniques (e.g., t-SNE). However, neither approach effectively scales to large datasets because images are ineffectively organized and interactions are insufficiently supported. To address these challenges, we develop DendroMap by adapting Treemaps, a well-known visualization technique. DendroMap effectively organizes images by extracting hierarchical cluster structures from high-dimensional representations of images. It enables users to make sense of the overall distributions of datasets and interactively zoom into specific areas of interests at multiple levels of abstraction. Our case studies with widely-used image datasets for deep learning demonstrate that users can discover insights about datasets and trained models by examining the diversity of images, identifying underperforming subgroups, and analyzing classification errors. We conducted a user study that evaluates the effectiveness of DendroMap in grouping and searching tasks by comparing it with a gridified version of t-SNE and found that participants preferred DendroMap. DendroMap is available at https://div-lab.github.io/dendromap/.",DendroMap: Visual Exploration of Large-Scale Image Datasets for Machine Learning with Treemaps,,R&I,2022
"Embedding is a common technique for analyzing multi-dimensional data. However, the embedding projection cannot always form significant and interpretable visual structures that foreshadow underlying data patterns. We propose an approach that incorporates human knowledge into data embeddings to improve pattern significance and interpretability. The core idea is (1) externalizing tacit human knowledge as explicit sample labels and (2) adding a classification loss in the embedding network to encode samples’ classes. The approach pulls samples of the same class with similar data features closer in the projection, leading to more compact (significant) and class-consistent (interpretable) visual structures. We give an embedding network with a customized classification loss to implement the idea and integrate the network into a visualization system to form a workflow that supports flexible class creation and pattern exploration. Patterns found on open datasets in case studies, subjects’ performance in a user study, and quantitative experiment results illustrate the general usability and effectiveness of the approach.",Incorporation of Human Knowledge into Data Embeddings to Improve Pattern Significance and Interpretability,,A&D,2022
"There have been recent advances in the analysis and visualization of 3D symmetric tensor fields, with a focus on the robust extraction of tensor field topology. However, topological features such as degenerate curves and neutral surfaces do not live in isolation. Instead, they intriguingly interact with each other. In this paper, we introduce the notion of {\em topological graph} for 3D symmetric tensor fields to facilitate global topological analysis of such fields. The nodes of the graph include degenerate curves and regions bounded by neutral surfaces in the domain. The edges in the graph denote the adjacency information between the regions and degenerate curves. In addition, we observe that a degenerate curve can be a loop and even a knot and that two degenerate curves (whether in the same region or not) can form a link. We provide a definition and theoretical analysis of individual degenerate curves in order to help understand why knots and links may occur. Moreover, we differentiate between wedges and trisectors, thus making the analysis more detailed about degenerate curves. We incorporate this information into the topological graph. Such a graph can not only reveal the global structure in a 3D symmetric tensor field but also allow two symmetric tensor fields to be compared. We demonstrate our approach by applying it to solid mechanics and material science data sets.",Global Topology of 3D Symmetric Tensor Fields,"Tensor field visualization, 3D symmetric tensor fields, global tensor field topology, topological graphs, degenerate curves, neutral surfaces, wedges and trisectors",DTr,2023
"Geographic regression models of various descriptions are often applied to identify patterns and anomalies in the determinants of spatially distributed observations. These types of analyses focus on answering why questions about underlying spatial phenomena, e.g., why is crime higher in this locale, why do children in one school district outperform those in another, etc.? Answers to these questions require explanations of the model structure, the choice of parameters, and contextualization of the findings with respect to their geographic context. This is particularly true for local forms of regression models which are focused on the role of locational context in determining human behavior. In this paper, we present GeoExplainer, a visual analytics framework designed to support analysts in creating explanative documentation that summarizes and contextualizes their spatial analyses. As analysts create their spatial models, our framework flags potential issues with model parameter selections, utilizes template-based text generation to summarize model outputs, and links with external knowledge repositories to provide annotations that help to explain the model results. As analysts explore the model results, all visualizations and annotations can be captured in an interactive report generation widget. We demonstrate our framework using a case study modeling the determinants of voting in the 2016 US Presidential Election.",GeoExplainer: A Visual Analytics Framework for Spatial Modeling Contextualization and Report Generation,"Spatial data analysis, local models, multiscale geographically weighted regression, model explanation, visual analytics",A&D,2023
"Designing responsive visualizations for various screen types can be tedious as authors must manage multiple chart~versions across design iterations. Automated approaches for responsive visualization must take into account the user's need for agency in exploring possible design ideas and applying customizations based on their own goals. We design and implement Dupo, a mixed-initiative approach to creating responsive visualizations that combines the agency afforded by a manual interface with automation provided by a recommender system. Given an initial design, users can browse automated design suggestions for a different screen type and make edits to a chosen design, thereby supporting quick prototyping and customizability. Dupo employs a two-step recommender pipeline that first suggests significant design changes (Exploration) followed by more subtle changes (Alteration). We evaluated Dupo with six expert responsive visualization authors. While creating responsive versions of a source design in Dupo, participants could reason about different design suggestions without having to manually prototype them, and thus avoid prematurely fixating on a particular design. This process led participants to create designs that they were satisfied with but which they had previously overlooked.",Dupo: A Mixed-Initiative Authoring Tool for Responsive Visualization,"Visualization, responsive visualization, mixed-initiative authoring",S&R,2023
"Hypergraph visualization has many applications in network data analysis. Recently, a polygon-based representation for hypergraphs has been proposed with demonstrated benefits. However, the polygon-based layout often suffers from excessive self-intersections when the input dataset is relatively large. In this paper, we propose a framework in which the hypergraph is iteratively simplified through a set of atomic operations. Then, the layout of the simplest hypergraph is optimized and used as the foundation for a reverse process that brings the simplest hypergraph back to the original one, but with an improved layout. At the core of our approach is the set of atomic simplification operations and an operation priority measure to guide the simplification process. In addition, we introduce necessary definitions and conditions for hypergraph planarity within the polygon representation. We extend our approach to handle simultaneous simplification and layout optimization for both the hypergraph and its dual. We demonstrate the utility of our approach with datasets from a number of real-world applications.",Scalable Hypergraph Visualization,"Hypergraph visualization, scalable visualization, polygon layout, hypergraph embedding, primal-dual visualization",R&I,2023
"In 2D visualizations, visibility of every datum's representation is crucial to ease the completion of visual tasks. Such a guarantee is barely respected in complex visualizations, mainly because of overdraws between datum representations that hide parts of the information (e.g., outliers). The literature proposes various Layout Adjustment algorithms to improve the readability of visualizations that suffer from this issue. Manipulating the data in high-dimensional, geometric or visual space; they rely on different strategies with their own strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, most of these algorithms are computationally expensive as they search for an exact solution in the geometric space and do not scale well to large datasets. This article proposes GIST, a layout adjustment algorithm that aims at optimizing three criteria: (i) node visibility guarantee (at least 1 pixel), (ii) node size maximization, and (iii) the original layout preservation. This is achieved by combining a search for the maximum node size that enables to draw all the data points without overlaps, with a limited budget of movements (i.e., limiting the distortions of the original layout). The method's basis relies on the idea that it is not necessary for two data representations to be strictly not overlapping in order to guarantee their visibility in visual space.  Our algorithm therefore uses a tolerance in the geometric space to determine the overlaps between pairs of data.  The tolerance is optimized such that the approximation computed in the geometric space can lead to visualization without noticeable overdraw after the data rendering rasterization. In addition, such an approximation helps to ease the algorithm's convergence as it reduces the number of constraints to resolve, enabling it to handle large datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by comparing its results to those of state-of-the-art methods on several large datasets.",Guaranteed Visibility in Scatterplots with Tolerance,"Guaranteed visibility, Layout adjustment, Overlap removal, Scatterplots",S&R,2023
"This paper is a call to action for research and discussion on data visualization education. As visualization evolves and spreads through our professional and personal lives, we need to understand how to support and empower a broad and diverse community of learners in visualization. Data Visualization is a diverse and dynamic discipline that combines knowledge from different fields, is tailored to suit diverse audiences and contexts, and frequently incorporates tacit knowledge. This complex nature leads to a series of interrelated challenges for data visualization education. Driven by a lack of consolidated knowledge, overview, and orientation for visualization education, the 21 authors of this paper—educators and researchers in data visualization—identify and describe 19 challenges informed by our collective practical experience. We organize these challenges around seven themes People, Goals & Assessment, Environment, Motivation, Methods, Materials, and Change. Across these themes, we formulate 43 research questions to address these challenges. As part of our call to action, we then conclude with 5 cross-cutting opportunities and respective action items: embrace DIVERSITY+INCLUSION, build COMMUNITIES, conduct RESEARCH, act AGILE, and relish RESPONSIBILITY. We aim to inspire researchers, educators and learners to drive visualization education forward and discuss why, how, who and where we educate, as we learn to use visualization to address challenges across many scales and many domains in a rapidly changing world: viseducationchallenges.github.io",Challenges and Opportunities in Data Visualization Education: A Call to Action,"Data Visualization, Education, Challenges",T&E,2023
"Although many deep-learning-based super-resolution approaches have been proposed in recent years, because no ground truth is available in the inference stage, few can quantify the errors and uncertainties of the super-resolved results. For scientific visualization applications, however, conveying uncertainties of the results to scientists is crucial to avoid generating misleading or incorrect information. In this paper, we propose PSRFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based generative model for scientific data super-resolution that incorporates uncertainty quantification into the super-resolution process. PSRFlow learns the conditional distribution of the high-resolution data based on the low-resolution counterpart. By sampling from a Gaussian latent space that captures the missing information in the high-resolution data, one can generate different plausible super-resolution outputs. The efficient sampling in the Gaussian latent space allows our model to perform uncertainty quantification for the super-resolved results. During model training, we augment the training data with samples across various scales to make the model adaptable to data of different scales, achieving flexible super-resolution for a given input. Our results demonstrate superior performance and robust uncertainty quantification compared with existing methods such as interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution networks.",PSRFlow: Probabilistic Super Resolution with Flow-Based Models for Scientific Data,"Super resolution, latent space, normalizing flow, uncertainty visualization",DTr,2023
"The correlation between children’s personal and family characteristics (e.g., demographics and socioeconomic status) and their physical and mental health status has been extensively studied across various research domains, such as public health, medicine, and data science. Such studies can provide insights into the underlying factors affecting children’s health and aid in the development of targeted interventions to improve their health outcomes. However, with the availability of multiple data sources, including context data (i.e., the background information of children) and motion data (i.e., sensor data measuring activities of children), new challenges have arisen due to the large-scale, heterogeneous, and multimodal nature of the data. Existing statistical hypothesis-based and learning model-based approaches have been inadequate for comprehensively analyzing the complex correlation between multimodal features and multi-dimensional health outcomes due to the limited information revealed. In this work, we first distill a set of design requirements from multiple levels through conducting a literature review and iteratively interviewing 11 experts from multiple domains (e.g., public health and medicine). Then, we propose HealthPrism, an interactive visual and analytics system for assisting researchers in exploring the importance and influence of various context and motion features on children’s health status from multi-level perspectives. Within HealthPrism, a multimodal learning model with a gate mechanism is proposed for health profiling and cross-modality feature importance comparison. A set of visualization components is designed for experts to explore and understand multimodal data freely. We demonstrate the effectiveness and usability of HealthPrism through quantitative evaluation of the model performance, case studies, and expert interviews in associated domains.",HealthPrism: A Visual Analytics System for Exploring Children's Physical and Mental Health Profiles with Multimodal Data,"Visual Analytics, Health Profiling, Multimodal Learning, Context Data, Motion Data",App,2023
"Smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a mesh-free method used to simulate volumetric media in fluids, astrophysics, and solid mechanics. Visualizing these simulations is problematic because these datasets often contain millions, if not billions of particles carrying physical attributes and moving over time. Radial basis functions (RBFs) are used to model particles, and overlapping particles are interpolated to reconstruct a high-quality volumetric field; however, this interpolation process is expensive and makes interactive visualization difficult. Existing RBF interpolation schemes do not account for color-mapped attributes and are instead constrained to visualizing just the density field. To address these challenges, we exploit ray tracing cores in modern GPU architectures to accelerate scalar field reconstruction. We use a novel RBF interpolation scheme to integrate per-particle colors and densities, and leverage GPU-parallel tree construction and refitting to quickly update the tree as the simulation animates over time or when the user manipulates particle radii. We also propose a Hilbert reordering scheme to cluster particles together at the leaves of the tree to reduce tree memory consumption. Finally, we reduce the noise of volumetric shadows by adopting a spatially temporal blue noise sampling scheme. Our method can provide a more detailed and interactive view of these large, volumetric, time-series particle datasets than traditional methods, leading to new insights into these physics simulations.",Attribute-Aware RBFs: Interactive Visualization of Time Series Particle Volumes Using RT Core Range Queries,"Ray Tracing, Volume Rendering, Particle Volumes, Radial Basis Functions, Scientific Visualization",S&R,2023
"To facilitate the reuse of existing charts, previous research has examined how to obtain a semantic understanding of a chart by deconstructing its visual representation into reusable components, such as encodings. However, existing deconstruction approaches primarily focus on chart styles, handling only basic layouts. In this paper, we investigate how to deconstruct chart layouts, focusing on rectangle-based ones, as they cover not only 17 chart types but also advanced layouts (e.g., small multiples, nested layouts). We develop an interactive tool, called Mystique, adopting a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legend, and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Mystique employs a wizard interface that guides chart authors through a series of steps to specify how the deconstructed components map to their own data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts, Mystique achieves above 85% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96% accuracy for layout deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions.",Mystique: Deconstructing SVG Charts for Layout Reuse,"Chart layout, Reuse, Reverse-engineering, Deconstruction.",R&I,2023
"Immersive analytics has emerged as a promising research area, leveraging advances in immersive display technologies and techniques, such as virtual and augmented reality, to facilitate data exploration and decision-making. This paper presents a systematic literature review of 73 studies published between 2013-2022 on immersive analytics systems and visualizations, aiming to identify and categorize the primary dimensions influencing their design. We identified five key dimensions: Academic Theory and Contribution, Immersive Technology, Data, Spatial Presentation, and Visual Presentation. Academic Theory and Contribution assess the motivations behind the works and their theoretical frameworks. Immersive Technology examines the display and input modalities, while Data dimension focuses on dataset types and generation. Spatial Presentation discusses the environment, space, embodiment, and collaboration aspects in IA, and Visual Presentation explores the visual elements, facet and position, and manipulation of views. By examining each dimension individually and cross-referencing them, this review uncovers trends and relationships that help inform the design of immersive systems visualizations.

"This work involves joint efforts between visualization and humanities researchers, aiming at building a holistic view of the cultural exchange and integration between China and Japan brought about by the overseas circulation of Chinese classics. Book circulation data consist of uncertain spatiotemporal trajectories, with multiple dimensions, and movement across hierarchical spaces forms a compound network. LiberRoad visualizes the circulation of books collected in the Imperial Household Agency of Japan, and can be generalized to other book movement data. The LiberRoad system enables a smooth transition between three views (Location Graph, map, and timeline) according to the desired perspectives (spatial or temporal), as well as flexible filtering and selection. The Location Graph is a novel uncertainty-aware visualization method that employs improved circle packing to represent spatial hierarchy. The map view intuitively shows the overall circulation by clustering and allows zooming into single book trajectory with lenses magnifying local movements. The timeline view ranks dynamically in response to user interaction to facilitate the discovery of temporal events. The evaluation and feedback from the expert users demonstrate that LiberRoad is helpful in revealing movement patterns and comparing circulation characteristics of different times and spaces.",Marjorie: Visualizing Type 1 Diabetes Data to Support Pattern Exploration,"Design study, task analysis, diabetes, time series data, visual analytics, clustering",App,2023
"Icicles and sunbursts are two commonly-used visual representations of trees. While icicle trees can map data values faithfully to rectangles of different sizes, often some rectangles are too narrow to be noticed easily. When an icicle tree is transformed into a sunburst tree, the width of each rectangle becomes the length of an annular sector that is usually longer than the original width. While sunburst trees alleviate the problem of narrow rectangles in icicle trees, it no longer maintains the consistency of size encoding. At different tree depths, nodes of the same data values are displayed in annular sections of different sizes in a sunburst tree, though they are represented by rectangles of the same size in an icicle tree. Furthermore, two nodes from different subtrees could sometimes appear as a single node in both icicle trees and sunburst trees. In this paper, we propose a new visual representation, referred to as radial icicle tree (RIT), which transforms the rectangular bounding box of an icicle tree into a circle, circular sector, or annular sector while introducing gaps between nodes and maintaining area constancy for nodes of the same size. We applied the new visual design to several datasets. Both the analytical design process and user-centered evaluation have confirmed that this new design has improved the design of icicles and sunburst trees without introducing any relative demerit.",Radial Icicle Tree (RIT): Node Separation and Area Constancy,"Tree visualization, icicle tree, sunburst tree, size encoding, area constancy, node separation, radial icicle tree, RIT",R&I,2023
"How do people internalize visualizations: as images or information? In this study, we investigate the nature of internalization for visualizations (i.e., how the mind encodes visualizations in memory) and how memory encoding affects its retrieval. This exploratory work examines the influence of various design elements on a user's perception of a chart. Specifically, which design elements lead to perceptions of visualization as an image (aims to provide visual references, evoke emotions, express creativity, and inspire philosophic thought) or as information (aims to present complex data, information, or ideas concisely and promote analytical thinking)? Understanding how design elements contribute to viewers perceiving a visualization more as an image or information will help designers decide which elements to include to achieve their communication goals. For this study, we annotated 500 visualizations and analyzed the responses of 250 online participants, who rated the visualizations on a bilinear scale as 'image' or 'information.' We then conducted an in-person study (n = 101) using a free recall task to examine how the image/information ratings and design elements impacted memory. The results revealed several interesting findings: Image-rated visualizations were perceived as more aesthetically 'appealing,' 'enjoyable,' and 'pleasing.'  Information-rated visualizations were perceived as less 'difficult to understand' and more aesthetically 'likable' and 'nice,' though participants expressed higher 'positive' sentiment when viewing image-rated visualizations and felt less 'guided to a conclusion.' The presence of axes and text annotations heavily influenced the likelihood of participants rating the visualization as 'information.' We also found different patterns among participants that were older. Importantly, we show that visualizations internalized as 'images' are less effective in conveying trends and messages, though they elicit a more positive emotional judgment, while 'informative' visualizations exhibit annotation focused recall and elicit a more positive design judgment. We discuss the implications of this dissociation between aesthetic pleasure and perceived ease of use in visualization design.",Image or Information?

In this work, we present a new visualization technique designed to help researchers understand the self-attention mechanism in transformers that allows these models to learn rich, contextual relationships between elements of a sequence. The main idea behind our method is to visualize a joint embedding of the query and key vectors used by transformer models to compute attention. Unlike previous attention visualization techniques, our approach enables the analysis of global patterns across multiple input sequences. We create an interactive visualization tool, AttentionViz (demo: http://attentionviz.com), based on these joint query-key embeddings, and use it to study attention mechanisms in both language and vision transformers.

"When telling a data story, an author has an intention they seek to convey to an audience. This intention can be of many forms such as to persuade, to educate, to inform, or even to entertain. In addition to expressing their intention, the story plot must balance being consumable and enjoyable while preserving scientific integrity. In data stories, numerous methods have been identified for constructing and presenting a plot. However, there is an opportunity to expand how we think and create the visual elements that present the story. Stories are brought to life by characters; often they are what make a story captivating, enjoyable, memorable, and facilitate following the plot until the end. Through the analysis of 160 existing data stories, we systematically investigate and identify distinguishable features of characters in data stories, and we illustrate how they feed into the broader concept of “character-oriented design”. We identify the roles and visual representations data characters assume as well as the types of relationships these roles have with one another. We identify characteristics of antagonists as well as define conflict in data stories. We find the need for an identifiable central character that the audience latches on to in order to follow the narrative and identify their visual representations. We then illustrate “character-oriented design” by showing how to develop data characters with common data story plots. With this work, we present a framework for data characters derived from our analysis; we then offer our extension to the data storytelling process using character-oriented design.

"We investigate the use of 2D black-and-white textures for the visualization of categorical data and contribute a summary of texture attributes, and the results of three experiments that elicited design strategies as well as aesthetic and effectiveness measures. Black-and-white textures are useful, for instance, as a visual channel for categorical data on low-color displays, in 2D/3D print, to achieve the aesthetic of historic visualizations, or to retain the color hue channel for other visual mappings. We specifically study how to use what we call geometric and iconic textures. Geometric textures use patterns of repeated abstract geometric shapes, while iconic textures use repeated icons that may stand for data categories. We parameterized both types of textures and developed a tool for designers to create textures on simple charts by adjusting texture parameters. 30 visualization experts used our tool and designed 66 textured bar charts, pie charts, and maps. We then had 150 participants rate these designs for aesthetics. Finally, with the top-rated geometric and iconic textures, our perceptual assessment experiment with 150 participants revealed that textured charts perform about equally well as non-textured charts, and that there are some differences depending on the type of chart.",Design Characterization for Black-and-White Textures in Visualization,"Aesthetics, textures, icons, black and white, visualization, visual representations, categorical data, design, perception",R&I,2023
"Grid visualizations are widely used in many applications to visually explain a set of data and their proximity relationships. However, existing layout methods face difficulties when dealing with the inherent cluster structures within the data. To address this issue, we propose a cluster-aware grid layout method that aims to better preserve cluster structures by simultaneously considering proximity, compactness, and convexity in the optimization process. Our method utilizes a hybrid optimization strategy that consists of two phases. The global phase aims to balance proximity and compactness within each cluster, while the local phase ensures the convexity of cluster shapes. We evaluate the proposed grid layout method through a series of quantitative experiments and two use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in preserving cluster structures and facilitating analysis tasks.",Cluster-Aware Grid Layout,"Grid layout, similarity, convexity, compactness, optimization",S&R,2023

"Situated visualizations are a type of visualization where data is presented next to its physical referent (i.e., the physical object, space, or person it refers to), often using augmented-reality displays. While situated visualizations can be benefcial in various contexts and have received research attention, they are typically designed with the assumption that the physical referent is visible. However, in practice, a physical referent may be obscured by another object, such as a wall, or may be outside the user’s visual feld.

"Computational notebooks have become increasingly popular for exploratory data analysis due to their ability to support data exploration and explanation within a single document. Effective documentation for explaining chart findings during the exploration process is essential as it helps recall and share data analysis. However, documenting chart findings remains a challenge due to its time-consuming and tedious nature.  While existing automatic methods alleviate some of the burden on users, they often fail to cater to users' specific interests.  In response to these limitations, we present InkSight, a mixed-initiative computational notebook plugin that generates finding documentation based on the user's intent. InkSight allows users to express their intent in specific data subsets through sketching atop visualizations intuitively. To facilitate this, we designed two types of sketches, i.e., open-path and closed-path sketch. Upon receiving a user's sketch, InkSight identifies the sketch type and corresponding selected data items.  Subsequently, it filters data fact types based on the sketch and selected data items  before employing existing automatic data fact recommendation algorithms to infer data facts.  Using large language models (GPT-3.5), InkSight converts data facts into effective natural language documentation. Users can conveniently fine-tune the generated documentation within InkSight.

"In soccer, player action evaluation provides a fine-grained method to analyze player performance and plays an important role in improving winning chances in future matches. However, previous studies on action evaluation only provide a score for each action, and hardly support inspecting and comparing player actions integrated with complex match context information such as team tactics and player locations. In this work, we collaborate with soccer analysts and coaches to characterize the domain problems of evaluating player performance based on action scores. We design a tailored visualization of soccer player actions that places the action choice together with the tactic it belongs to as well as the player locations in the same view. Based on the design, we introduce a visual analytics system, Action-Evaluator, to facilitate a comprehensive player action evaluation through player navigation, action investigation, and action explanation. With the system, analysts can find players to be analyzed efficiently, learn how they performed under various match situations, and obtain valuable insights to improve their action choices.

"Profiling data by plotting distributions and analyzing summary statistics is a critical step throughout data analysis. Currently, this process is manual and tedious since analysts must write extra code to examine their data after every transformation. This inefficiency may lead to data scientists profiling their data infrequently, rather than after each transformation, making it easy for them to miss important errors or insights. We propose continuous data profiling as a process that allows analysts to immediately see interactive visual summaries of their data throughout their data analysis to facilitate fast and thorough analysis. Our system, AutoProfiler, presents three ways to support continuous data profiling: (1) it automatically displays data distributions and summary statistics to facilitate data comprehension; (2) it is live, so visualizations are always accessible and update automatically as the data updates; (3) it supports follow up analysis and documentation by authoring code for the user in the notebook. In a user study with 16 participants, we evaluate two versions of our system that integrate different levels of automation: both automatically show data profiles and facilitate code authoring, however, one version updates reactively (""live"") and the other updates only on demand (""dead""). We find that both tools, dead or alive, facilitate insight discovery with 91% of user-generated insights originating from the tools rather than manual profiling code written by users. Participants found live updates intuitive and felt it helped them verify their transformations while those with on-demand profiles liked the ability to look at past visualizations. We also present a longitudinal case study on how AutoProfiler helped domain scientists find serendipitous insights about their data through automatic, live data profiles.

However, designing a good color palette for a chart is a challenging task for novice users who lack related design expertise. For example, they often find it difficult to articulate their abstract intentions and translate these intentions into effective editing actions to achieve a desired outcome. In this work, we present NL2Color, a tool that allows novice users to modify chart color palettes using natural language expressions of their desired outcomes. We first collected and categorized a dataset of 131 triplets, each consisting of an original color palette of a chart, an editing intent, and a new color palette designed by human experts according to the intent. Our tool employs a large language model (LLM) to substitute the colors in original palettes and produce new color palettes by selecting some of the triplets as few-shot prompts. To evaluate our tool, we conducted a comprehensive two-stage evaluation, including a crowd-sourcing study (N=71) and a within-subjects user study (N=12). The results indicate that the quality of the color palettes revised by NL2Color has no significantly large difference from those designed by human experts. The participants who used NL2Color obtained revised color palettes to their satisfaction in a shorter period and with less effort.",NL2Color: Refining Color Palettes for Charts with Natural Language,"chart, color palette, natural language, large language model",R&I,2023
"We present InvVis, a new approach for invertible visualization, which is reconstructing or further modifying a visualization from an image. InvVis allows the embedding of a significant amount of data, such as chart data, chart information, source code, etc., into visualization images. The encoded image is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. We propose a new method to efficiently express chart data in the form of images, enabling large-capacity data embedding. We also outline a model based on the invertible neural network to achieve high-quality data concealing and revealing. We explore and implement a variety of application scenarios of InvVis. Additionally, we conduct a series of evaluation experiments to assess our method from multiple perspectives, including data embedding quality, data restoration accuracy, data encoding capacity, etc. The result of our experiments demonstrates the great potential of InvVis in invertible visualization.",InvVis: Large-Scale Data Embedding for Invertible Visualization,"Information visualization, information steganography, invertible visualization, invertible neural network.",DTr,2023
"Optimal ski route selection is a challenge based on a multitude of factors, such as the steepness, compass direction, or crowdedness. The personal preferences of every skier towards these factors require individual adaptations, which aggravate this task. Current approaches within this domain do not combine automated routing capabilities with user preferences, missing out on the possibility of integrating domain knowledge in the analysis process. We introduce SkiVis, a visual analytics application to interactively explore ski slopes and provide routing recommendations based on user preferences. In collaboration with ski guides and enthusiasts, we elicited requirements and guidelines for such an application and propose different workflows depending on the skiers' familiarity with the resort. In a case study on the resort of Ski Arlberg, we illustrate how to leverage volunteered geographic information to enable a numerical comparison between slopes. We evaluated our approach through a pair-analytics study and demonstrate how it supports skiers in discovering relevant and preference-based ski routes. Besides the tasks investigated in the study, we derive additional use cases from the interviews that showcase the further potential of SkiVis, and contribute directions for further research opportunities.",SkiVis: Visual Exploration and Route Planning in Ski Resorts,"Geographic Visualization, Routing",App,2023
"Line-based density plots are used to reduce visual clutter in line charts with a multitude of individual lines. However, these traditional density plots are often perceived ambiguously, which obstructs the user's identification of underlying trends in complex datasets. Thus, we propose a novel image space coloring method for line-based density plots that enhances their interpretability. Our method employs color not only to visually communicate data density but also to highlight similar regions in the plot, allowing users to identify and distinguish trends easily. We achieve this by performing hierarchical clustering based on the lines passing through each region and mapping the identified clusters to the hue circle using circular MDS. Additionally, we propose a heuristic approach to assign each line to the most probable cluster, enabling users to analyze density and individual lines. We motivate our method by conducting a small-scale user study, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method using synthetic and real-world datasets, and providing an interactive online tool for generating colored line-based density plots.",Reducing Ambiguity in Line-based Density Plots by Image-space Colorization,"Trajectory data, times series, density-based visualization, clustering, coloring",S&R,2023
"Tropical cyclones (TCs) are among the most destructive weather systems. Realistically and efficiently detecting and tracking TCs are critical for assessing their impacts and risks. In particular, the eye is a signature feature of a mature TC. Therefore, knowing the eyes' locations and movements is crucial for both operational weather forecasts and climate risk assessments. Recently, a multilevel robustness framework has been introduced to study the critical points of time-varying vector fields. The framework quantifies the robustness (i.e., structural stability) of critical points across varying neighborhoods. By relating the multilevel robustness with critical point tracking, the framework has demonstrated its potential in cyclone tracking. An advantage is that it identifies cyclonic features using only 2D wind vector fields, which is encouraging as most tracking algorithms require multiple dynamic and thermodynamic variables at different altitudes. A disadvantage is that the framework does not scale well computationally for datasets containing a large number of cyclones.  This paper introduces a topologically robust physics-informed tracking framework (TROPHY) for TC tracking. The main idea is to integrate physical knowledge of TC to drastically improve the computational efficiency of multilevel robustness framework for large-scale climate datasets. First, during preprocessing, we propose a physics-informed feature selection strategy to filter 90% of critical points that are short-lived and have low stability, thus preserving good candidates for TC tracking. Second, during in-processing, we impose constraints during the multilevel robustness computation to focus only on physics-informed neighborhoods of TCs. We apply TROPHY to 30 years of 2D wind fields from reanalysis data in ERA5 and generate a number of TC tracks. In comparison with the observed tracks, we demonstrate that TROPHY can capture TC characteristics (e.g., frequency, intensity, duration, latitudes with maximum intensity, and genesis) that are comparable to and sometimes even better than a well-validated TC tracking algorithm that requires multiple dynamic and thermodynamic scalar fields.",TROPHY: A Topologically Robust Physics-Informed Tracking Framework for Tropical Cyclone,"Feature tracking, robustness, topology-based methods in visualization, applications, climate science, tropical cyclones",App,2023
"Understanding how helpful a visualization is from experimental results is difficult because the observed performance is confounded with aspects of the study design, such as how useful the information that is visualized is for the task. We develop a rational agent framework for designing and interpreting visualization experiments. Our framework conceives two experiments with the same setup: one with behavioral agents (human subjects), and the other one with a hypothetical rational agent. A visualization is evaluated by comparing the expected performance of behavioral agents to that of a rational agent under different assumptions. Using recent visualization decision studies from the literature, we demonstrate how the framework can be used to pre-experimentally evaluate the experiment design by bounding the expected improvement in performance from having access to visualizations, and post-experimentally to deconfound errors of information extraction from errors of optimization, among other analyses.",The Rational Agent Benchmark for Data Visualization,"Evaluation, decision-making, rational agent, scoring rule",T&E,2023
"This paper extends the concept and the visualization of vector field topology to vector fields with discontinuities. We address the non-uniqueness of flow in such fields by introduction of a time-reversible concept of equivalence. This concept generalizes streamlines to streamsets and thus vector field topology to discontinuous vector fields in terms of invariant streamsets. We identify respective novel critical structures as well as their manifolds, investigate their interplay with traditional vector field topology, and detail the application and interpretation of our approach using specifically designed synthetic cases and a simulated case from physics.",Visualization of Discontinuous Vector Field Topology,"Discontinuous vector field topology, equivalence in non-unique flow, non-smooth dynamical systems",DTr,2023
"Unstructured meshes are characterized by data points irregularly distributed in the Euclidian space. Due to the irregular nature of these data, computing connectivity information between the mesh elements requires much more time and memory than on uniformly distributed data. To lower storage costs, dynamic data structures have been proposed. These data structures compute connectivity information on the fly and discard them when no longer needed. However, on-the-fly computation slows down algorithms and results in a negative impact on the time performance. To address this issue, we propose a new task-parallel approach to proactively compute mesh connectivity. Unlike previous approaches implementing data-parallel models, where all threads run the same type of instructions, our task-parallel approach allows threads to run different functions. Specifically, some threads run the algorithm of choice while other threads compute connectivity information before they are actually needed. The approach was implemented in the new Accelerated Clustered TOPOlogical (ACTOPO) data structure, which can support any processing algorithm requiring mesh connectivity information. Our experiments show that ACTOPO combines the benefits of state-of-the-art memory-efficient (TTK CompactTriangulation) and time-efficient (TTK ExplicitTriangulation) topological data structures. It occupies a similar amount of memory as TTK CompactTriangulation while providing up to 5x speedup. Moreover, it achieves comparable time performance as TTK ExplicitTriangulation while using only half of the memory space.",A Task-Parallel Approach for Localized Topological Data Structures,"Data structures, parallel computation, topological data analysis, simplicial complex",S&R,2023
"Unexploded Ordnance (UXO) detection, the identification of remnant active bombs buried underground from archival aerial images, implies a complex workflow involving decision-making at each stage. An essential phase in UXO detection is the task of image selection, where a small subset of images must be chosen from archives to reconstruct an area of interest (AOI) and identify craters. The selected image set must comply with good spatial and temporal coverage over the AOI, particularly in the temporal vicinity of recorded aerial attacks, and do so with minimal images for resource optimization. This paper presents a guidance-enhanced visual analytics prototype to select images for UXO detection. In close collaboration with domain experts, our design process involved analyzing user tasks, eliciting expert knowledge, modeling quality metrics, and choosing appropriate guidance. We report on a user study with two real-world scenarios of image selection performed with and without guidance. Our solution was well-received and deemed highly usable. Through the lens of our task-based design and developed quality measures, we observed guidance-driven changes in user behavior and improved quality of analysis results. An expert evaluation of the study allowed us to improve our guidance-enhanced prototype further and discuss new possibilities for user-adaptive guidance.",Guided Visual Analytics for Image Selection in Time and Space,"Application Motivated Visualization, Geospatial Data, Mixed Initiative Human-Machine Analysis, Process/Workflow Design, Task Abstractions & Application Domains, Temporal Data",App,2023
"Visualization for machine learning (VIS4ML) research aims to help experts apply their prior knowledge to develop, understand, and improve the performance of machine learning models. In conceiving VIS4ML systems, researchers characterize the nature of human knowledge to support human-in-the-loop tasks, design interactive visualizations to make ML components interpretable and elicit knowledge, and evaluate the effectiveness of human-model interchange. We survey recent VIS4ML papers to assess the generalizability of research contributions and claims in enabling human-in-the-loop ML. Our results show potential gaps between the current scope of VIS4ML research and aspirations for its use in practice. We find that while papers motivate that VIS4ML systems are applicable beyond the specific conditions studied, conclusions are often overfitted to non-representative scenarios, are based on interactions with a small set of ML experts and well-understood datasets, fail to acknowledge crucial dependencies, and hinge on decisions that lack justification. We discuss approaches to close the gap between aspirations and research claims and suggest documentation practices to report generality constraints that better acknowledge the exploratory nature of VIS4ML research.",Are We Closing the Loop Yet?

"Abstract—Statisticians are not only one of the earliest professional adopters of data visualization, but also some of its most prolific users. Understanding how these professionals utilize visual representations in their analytic process may shed light on best practices for visual sensemaking. We present results from an interview study involving 18 professional statisticians (19.7 years average in the profession) on three aspects: (1) their use of visualization in their daily analytic work; (2) their mental models of inferential statistical processes; and (3) their design recommendations for how to best represent statistical inferences. Interview sessions consisted of discussing inferential statistics, eliciting participant sketches of suitable visual designs, and finally, a design intervention with our proposed visual designs. We analyzed interview transcripts using thematic analysis and open coding, deriving thematic codes on statistical mindset, analytic process, and analytic toolkit. The key findings for each aspect are as follows: (1) statisticians make extensive use of visualization during all phases of their work (and not just when reporting results); (2) their mental models of inferential methods tend to be mostly visually based; and (3) many statisticians abhor dichotomous thinking. The latter suggests that a multi-faceted visual display of inferential statistics that includes a visual indicator of analytically important effect sizes may help to balance the attributed epistemic power of traditional statistical testing with an awareness of the uncertainty of sensemaking.",Visualization According to Statisticians: An Interview Study on the Role of Visualization for Inferential Statistics,"Inferential statistics, qualitative interview study, thematic coding, statistical visualization",T&E,2023
"Labels are widely used in augmented reality (AR) to display digital information. Ensuring the readability of AR labels requires placing them occlusion-free manner while keeping visual linkings legible, especially when multiple labels exist in the scene. Although existing optimization-based methods, such as force-based methods, are effective in managing AR labels in static scenarios, they often struggle in dynamic scenarios with constantly moving objects. This is due to their focus on generating layouts optimal for the current moment, neglecting future moments and leading to sub-optimal or unstable layouts over time. In this work, we present RL-LABEL, a deep reinforcement learning-based method intended for managing the placement of AR labels in scenarios involving moving objects. RL-LABEL considers both the current and predicted future states of objects and labels, such as positions and velocities, as well as the user’s viewpoint, to make informed decisions about label placement. It balances the trade-offs between immediate and long-term objectives. We tested RL-LABEL in simulated AR scenarios on two real-world datasets, showing that it effectively learns the decision-making process for long-term optimization, outperforming two baselines (i.e., no view management and a force-based method) by minimizing label occlusions, line intersections, and label movement distance. Additionally, a user study involving 18 participants indicates that, within our simulated environment, RL-LABEL excels over the baselines in aiding users to identify, compare, and summarize data on labels in dynamic scenes.",RL-LABEL: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach Intended for AR Label Placement in Dynamic Scenarios,"Augmented Reality, Reinforcement Learning, Label Placement, Dynamic Scenarios",S&R,2023
"Dr. KID is an algorithm that uses isometric decomposition for the physicalization of potato-shaped organic models in a puzzle fashion. The algorithm begins with creating a simple, regular triangular surface mesh of organic shapes, followed by iterative K-means clustering and remeshing. For clustering, we need similarity between triangles (segments) which is defined as a distance function. The distance function maps each triangle's shape to a single point in the virtual 3D space. Thus, the distance between the triangles indicates their degree of dissimilarity. K-means clustering uses this distance and sorts segments into k classes. After this, remeshing is applied to minimize the distance between triangles within the same cluster by making their shapes identical. Clustering and remeshing are repeated until the distance between triangles in the same cluster reaches an acceptable threshold. We adopt a curvature-aware strategy to determine the surface thickness and finalize puzzle pieces for 3D printing. Identical hinges and holes are created for assembling the puzzle components. For smoother outcomes, we use triangle subdivision along with curvature-aware clustering, generating curved triangular patches for 3D printing. Our algorithm was evaluated using various models, and the 3D-printed results were analyzed. Findings indicate that our algorithm performs reliably on target organic shapes with minimal loss of input geometry.",Dr. KID: Direct Remeshing and K-set Isometric Decomposition for Scalable Physicalization of Organic Shapes,"Physicalization, Physical visualization, 3D printing, Isometric decomposition, Direct remeshing, Biological structures, Intracellular compartments.",App,2023
"Line attributes such as width and dashing are commonly used to encode information. However, many questions on the perception of line attributes remain, such as how many levels of attribute variation can be distinguished or which line attributes are the preferred choices for which tasks. We conducted three studies to develop guidelines for using stylized lines to encode scalar data. In our first study, participants drew stylized lines to encode uncertainty information. Uncertainty is usually visualized alongside other data. Therefore, alternative visual channels are important for the visualization of uncertainty. Additionally, uncertainty—e.g., in weather forecasts—is a familiar topic to most people. Thus, we picked it for our visualization scenarios in study 1. We used the results of our study to determine the most common line attributes for drawing uncertainty: Dashing, luminance, wave amplitude, and width. While those line attributes were especially common for drawing uncertainty, they are also commonly used in other areas. In studies 2 and 3, we investigated the discriminability of the line attributes determined in study 1. Studies 2 and 3 did not require specific application areas; thus, their results apply to visualizing any scalar data in line attributes. We evaluated the just-noticeable differences (JND) and derived recommendations for perceptually distinct line levels. We found that participants could discriminate considerably more levels for the line attribute width than for wave amplitude, dashing, or luminance.",Perception of Line Attributes for Visualization,"Line Drawings, Line Stylization, Perceptual Evaluation, Uncertainty Visualization.",T&E,2023
"Data visualization has the power to revolutionize sports. For example, the rise of shot maps has changed basketball strategy by visually illustrating where “good/bad” shots are taken from. As a result, professional basketball teams today take shots from very different positions on the court than they did 20 years ago. Although the shot map has transformed many facets of the game, there is still much room for improvement to support richer and more complex analytical tasks. More specifically, we believe that the lack of sufficient interactivity to support various analytical queries and the inability to visually compare differences across situations are significant limitations of current shot maps. To address these limitations and showcase new possibilities, we designed and developed HoopInSight, an interactive visualization system that centers around a novel spatial comparison visual technique, enhancing the capabilities of shot maps in basketball analytics. This article presents the system, with a focus on our proposed visual technique and its accompanying interactions, all designed to promote comparison of two different scenarios. Furthermore, we provide reflections on and a discussion of relevant issues, including considerations for designing spatial comparison techniques, the scalability and transferability of this approach, and the benefits and pitfalls of designing as domain experts.",HoopInSight: Analyzing and Comparing Basketball Shooting Performance Through Visualization,"sports data visualization, sports analytics, visual comparison, basketball",App,2023
"Topic models are a class of unsupervised learning algorithms for detecting the semantic structure within a text corpus. Together with a subsequent dimensionality reduction algorithm, topic models can be used for deriving spatializations for text corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots, reflecting semantic similarity between the documents and supporting corpus analysis. Although the choice of the topic model, the dimensionality reduction, and their underlying hyperparameters significantly impact the resulting layout, it is unknown which particular combinations result in high-quality layouts with respect to accuracy and perception metrics. To investigate the effectiveness of topic models and dimensionality reduction methods for the spatialization of corpora as two-dimensional scatter plots (or basis for landscape-type visualizations), we present a large-scale, benchmark-based computational evaluation. Our evaluation consists of (1) a set of corpora, (2) a set of layout algorithms that are combinations of topic models and dimensionality reductions, and (3) quality metrics for quantifying the resulting layout. The corpora are given as  document-term matrices, and each document is assigned to a thematic class. The chosen metrics quantify the preservation of local and global properties and the perceptual effectiveness of the two-dimensional scatter plots. By evaluating the benchmark on a computing cluster, we derived a multivariate dataset with over 45000 individual layouts and corresponding quality metrics. Based on the results, we propose guidelines for the effective design of text spatializations that are based on topic models and dimensionality reductions. As a main result, we show that interpretable topic models are beneficial for capturing the structure of text corpora. We furthermore recommend the use of t-SNE as a subsequent dimensionality reduction.",Large-Scale Evaluation of Topic Models and Dimensionality Reductions for 2D Text Spatialization,"Text visualization, spatialization, dimensionality reduction algorithms, topic modeling",DTr,2023

"Findings from graphical perception can guide visualization recommendation algorithms in identifying effective visualization designs. However, existing algorithms use knowledge from, at best, a few studies, limiting our understanding of how complementary (or contradictory) graphical perception results influence generated recommendations. In this paper, we present a pipeline of applying a large body of graphical perception results to develop new visualization recommendation algorithms and conduct an exploratory study to investigate how results from graphical perception can alter the behavior of downstream algorithms. Specifically, we model graphical perception results from 30 papers in Draco---a framework to model visualization knowledge---to develop new recommendation algorithms. By analyzing Draco-generated algorithms, we showcase the feasibility of our method to (1) identify gaps in existing graphical perception literature informing recommendation algorithms, (2) cluster papers by their preferred design rules and constraints, and (3) investigate why certain studies can dominate Draco's recommendations, whereas others may have little influence.

"Interaction is critical for data analysis and sensemaking. However, designing interactive physicalizations is challenging as it requires cross-disciplinary knowledge in visualization, fabrication, and electronics. Interactive physicalizations are typically produced in an unstructured manner, resulting in unique solutions for a specific dataset, problem, or interaction that cannot be easily extended or adapted to new scenarios or future physicalizations. To mitigate these challenges, we introduce a computational design pipeline to 3D print network physicalizations with integrated sensing capabilities. Networks are ubiquitous, yet their complex geometry also requires significant engineering considerations to provide intuitive, effective interactions for exploration. Using our pipeline, designers can readily produce network physicalizations supporting selection—the most critical atomic operation for interaction—by touch through capacitive sensing and computational inference. Our computational design pipeline introduces a new design paradigm by concurrently considering the form and interactivity of a physicalization into one cohesive fabrication workflow.

"With most modern visualization tools, authors need to transform their data into tidy formats to create visualizations they want. Because this requires experience with programming or separate data processing tools, data transformation remains a barrier in visualization authoring. To address this challenge, we present a new visualization paradigm, concept binding, that separates high-level visualization intents and low-level data transformation steps, leveraging an AI agent. We realize this paradigm in Data Formulator, an interactive visualization authoring tool. With Data Formulator, authors first define data concepts they plan to visualize using natural languages or examples, and then bind them to visual channels. Data Formulator then dispatches its AI-agent to automatically transform the input data to surface these concepts and generate desired visualizations. When presenting the results (transformed table and output visualizations) from the AI-agent, Data Formulator provides feedback to help authors inspect and understand them.

"In the face of complex decisions, people often engage in a three-stage process that spans from (1) exploring and analyzing pertinent information (intelligence); (2) generating and exploring alternative options (design); and ultimately culminating in (3) selecting the optimal decision by evaluating discerning criteria (choice). We can fairly assume that all good visualizations aid in the “intelligence” stage by enabling data exploration and analysis. Yet, to what degree and how do visualization systems currently support the other decision making stages, namely “design” and “choice”? To further explore this question, we conducted a comprehensive review of decision-focused visualization tools by examining publications in major visualization journals and conferences, including VIS, EuroVis, and CHI, spanning all available years. We employed a deductive coding method and in-depth analysis to assess whether and how visualization tools support design and choice. Specifically, we examined each visualization tool by (i) its degree of visibility for displaying decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences, and (ii) its degree of flexibility for offering means to manipulate the decision alternatives, criteria, and preferences with interactions such as adding, modifying, changing mapping, and filtering. Our review highlights the opportunities and challenges that decision-focused visualization tools face in realizing their full potential to support all stages of the decision making process. It reveals a surprising scarcity of tools that support all stages, and while most tools excel in offering visibility for decision criteria and alternatives, the degree of flexibility to manipulate these elements is often limited, and the lack of tools that accommodate decision preferences and their elicitation is notable. Based on our findings, to better support the choice stage, future research could explore enhancing flexibility levels and variety, exploring novel visualization paradigms, increasing algorithmic support, and ensuring that this automation is user-controlled via the enhanced flexibility levels.

"Visualization literacy is an essential skill for accurately interpreting data to inform critical decisions. Consequently, it is vital to understand the evolution of this ability and devise targeted interventions to enhance it, requiring concise and repeatable assessments of visualization literacy for individuals. However, current assessments, such as the Visualization Literacy Assessment Test (VLAT), are time-consuming due to their fixed, lengthy format. To address this limitation, we develop two streamlined computerized adaptive tests (CATs) for visualization literacy, A-VLAT and A-CALVI, which measure the same set of skills as their original versions in half the number of questions. Specifically, we (1) employ item response theory (IRT) and non-psychometric constraints to construct adaptive versions of the assessments, (2) finalize the configurations of adaptation through simulation, (3) refine the composition of test items of A-CALVI via a qualitative study, and (4) demonstrate the test-retest reliability (ICC: 0.98 and 0.98) and convergent validity (correlation: 0.81 and 0.66) of both CATs via four online studies.

"Machine learning technology has become ubiquitous, but, unfortunately, often exhibits bias. As a consequence, disparate stakeholders need to interact with and make informed decisions about using machine learning models in everyday systems. Visualization technology can support stakeholders in understanding and evaluating trade-offs between, for example, accuracy and fairness of models. This paper aims to empirically answer ""Can visualization design choices affect a stakeholder's perception of model bias, trust in a model, and willingness to adopt a model?'"" Through a series of controlled, crowd-sourced experiments with more than 1,500 participants, we identify a set of strategies people follow in deciding which models to trust. Our results show that men and women prioritize fairness and performance differently and that visual design choices significantly affect that prioritization. For example, women trust fairer models more often than men do, participants value fairness more when it is explained using text than as a bar chart, and being explicitly told a model is biased has a bigger impact than showing past biased performance. We test the generalizability of our results by comparing the effect of multiple textual and visual design choices and offer potential explanations of the cognitive mechanisms behind the difference in fairness perception and trust.

"Dashboards are no longer mere static displays of metrics; through functionality such as interaction and storytelling, they have evolved to support analytic and communicative goals like monitoring and reporting. Existing dashboard design guidelines, however, are often unable to account for this expanded scope as they largely focus on best practices for visual design. In contrast, we frame dashboard design as facilitating an analytical conversation: a cooperative, interactive experience where a user may interact with, reason about, or freely query the underlying data. By drawing on established principles of conversational flow and communication, we define the concept of a cooperative dashboard as one that enables a fruitful and productive analytical conversation, and derive a set of 39 dashboard design heuristics to support effective analytical conversations. To assess the utility of this framing, we asked 52 computer science and engineering graduate students to apply our heuristics to critique and design dashboards as part of an ungraded, opt-in homework assignment. Feedback from participants demonstrates that our heuristics surface new reasons dashboards may fail, and encourage a more fluid, supportive, and responsive style of dashboard design. Our approach suggests several compelling directions for future work, including dashboard authoring tools that better anticipate conversational turn-taking, repair, and refinement and extending cooperative principles to other analytical workflows.",Heuristics for Supporting Cooperative Dashboard Design,"Gricean maxims, interactive visualization, conversation initiation, grounding, turn-taking, repair and refinement.",T&E,2023

Knowledge about how scientific advances support marketplace inventions is therefore essential for understanding the role of science in propelling real-world applications and technological progress. The increasing availability of large-scale datasets tracing scientific publications and patented inventions and the complex interactions among them offers us new opportunities to explore the evolving dual frontiers of science and technology at an unprecedented level of scale and detail. However, we lack suitable visual analytics approaches to analyze such complex interactions effectively. Here we introduce InnovationInsights, an interactive visual analysis system for researchers, research institutions, and policymakers to explore the complex linkages between science and technology, and to identify critical innovations, inventors, and potential partners. The system first identifies important associations between scientific papers and patented inventions through a set of statistical measures introduced by our experts from the field of the Science of Science. A series of visualization views are then used to present these associations in the data context. In particular, we introduce the Interplay Graph to visualize patterns and insights derived from the data, helping users effectively navigate citation relationships between papers and patents. This visualization thereby helps them identify the origins of technical inventions and the impact of scientific research. We evaluate the system through two case studies with experts followed by expert interviews. We further engage a premier research institution to test-run the system, helping its institution leaders to extract new insights for innovation.

From these documents we know that they are 2-dimensional (2D) in nature. Hence, we are particularly interested in reconstructing 2D manifolds that approximate the document’s structure. The image data from which we want to reconstruct the 2D manifolds are often very noisy and represent folded, densely-layered structures with many artifacts, such as ruptures or layer splitting and merging. Previous ridge-surface extraction methods fail to extract the desired 2D manifold for such challenging data. We have therefore developed a novel method to extract 2D manifolds. The proposed method uses a local fast marching scheme in combination with a separation of the region covered by fast marching into two sub-regions. The 2D manifold of interest is then extracted as the surface separating the two sub-regions. The local scheme can be applied for both automatic propagation as well as interactive analysis. We demonstrate the applicability and robustness of our method on both artificial data as well as real-world data including folded silver and papyrus sheets.",A Local Iterative Approach for the Extraction of 2D Manifolds from Strongly Curved and Folded Thin-Layer Structures,"Ridge surface, crease surface, 2D manifold extraction, fast marching, virtual unfolding, historical documents",DTr,2023
"Big data and machine learning tools have jointly empowered humans in making data-driven decisions. However, many of them capture empirical associations that might be spurious due to confounding factors and subgroup heterogeneity. The famous Simpson’s paradox is such a phenomenon where aggregated and subgroup-level associations contradict with each other, causing cognitive confusions and difficulty in making adequate interpretations and decisions. Existing tools provide little insights for humans to locate, reason about, and prevent pitfalls of spurious association in practice. We propose VISPUR, a visual analytic system that provides a causal analysis framework and a human-centric workflow for tackling spurious associations. These include a CONFOUNDER DASHBOARD, which can automatically identify possible confounding factors, and a SUBGROUP VIEWER, which allows for the visualization and comparison of diverse subgroup patterns that likely or potentially result in a misinterpretation of causality. Additionally, we propose a REASONING STORYBOARD, which uses a flow-based approach to illustrate paradoxical phenomena, as well as an interactive DECISION DIAGNOSIS panel that helps ensure accountable decision-making. Through an expert interview and a controlled user experiment, our qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed “de-paradox” workflow and the designed visual analytic system are effective in helping human users to identify and understand spurious associations, as well as to make accountable causal decisions.",VISPUR: Visual Aids for Identifying and Interpreting Spurious Associations in Data-Driven Decisions,"Causal Analysis, Simpson’s Paradox, Spurious Associations, Machine Learning, Decision Making",A&D,2023
"The provision of fire services plays a vital role in ensuring the safety of residents' lives and property. The spatial layout of fire stations is closely linked to the efficiency of fire rescue operations. Traditional approaches have primarily relied on mathematical planning models to generate appropriate layouts by summarizing relevant evaluation criteria. However, this optimization process presents significant challenges due to the extensive decision space, inherent conflicts among criteria, and decision-makers' preferences. To address these challenges, we propose FSLens, an interactive visual analytics system that enables in-depth evaluation and rational optimization of fire station layout. Our approach integrates fire records and correlation features to reveal fire occurrence patterns and influencing factors using spatiotemporal sequence forecasting. We design an interactive visualization method to explore areas within the city that are potentially under-resourced for fire service based on the fire distribution and existing fire station layout. Moreover, we develop a collaborative human-computer multi-criteria decision model that generates multiple candidate solutions for optimizing firefighting resources within these areas. We simulate and compare the impact of different solutions on the original layout through well-designed visualizations, providing decision-makers with the most satisfactory solution. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through one case study with real-world datasets. The feedback from domain experts indicates that our system helps them to better identify and improve potential gaps in the current fire station layout.",FSLens: A Visual Analytics Approach to Evaluating and Optimizing the Spatial Layout of Fire Stations,"Spatiotemporal Analysis, Multi-criteria Decision Making, Visualization.",App,2023
"Trust is an essential aspect of data visualization, as it plays a crucial role in the interpretation and decision-making processes of users. While research in social sciences outlines the multi-dimensional factors that can play a role in trust formation, most data visualization trust researchers employ a single-item scale to measure trust. We address this gap by proposing a comprehensive, multidimensional conceptualization and operationalization of trust in visualization. We do this by applying general theories of trust from social sciences, as well as synthesizing and extending earlier work and factors identified by studies in the visualization field. We apply a two-dimensional approach to trust in visualization, to distinguish between cognitive and affective elements, as well as between visualization and data-specific trust antecedents. We use our framework to design and run a large crowd-sourced study to quantify the role of visual complexity in establishing trust in science visualizations. Our study provides empirical evidence for several aspects of our proposed theoretical framework, most notably the impact of cognition, affective responses, and individual differences when establishing trust in visualizations.",Vistrust: a Multidimensional Framework and Empirical Study of Trust in Data Visualizations,"Trust, visualization, science, framework",T&E,2023
"Relational information between different types of entities is often modelled by a multilayer network (MLN) -- a network with subnetworks represented by layers. The layers of an MLN can be arranged in different ways in a visual representation, however, the impact of the arrangement on the readability of the network is an open question. Therefore, we studied this impact for several commonly occurring tasks related to MLN analysis. Additionally, layer arrangements with a dimensionality beyond 2D, which are common in this scenario, motivate the use of stereoscopic displays. We ran a human subject study utilising a Virtual Reality headset to evaluate 2D, 2.5D, and 3D layer arrangements. The study employs six analysis tasks that cover the spectrum of an MLN task taxonomy, from path finding and pattern identification to comparisons between and across layers. We found no clear overall winner. However, we explore the task-to-arrangement space and derive empirical-based recommendations on the effective use of 2D, 2.5D, and 3D layer arrangements for MLNs.","2D, 2.5D, or 3D?

"Color maps are a commonly used visualization technique in which data are mapped to optical properties, e.g., color or opacity. Color maps, however, do not explicitly convey structures (e.g., positions and scale of features) within data. Topology-based visualizations reveal and explicitly communicate structures underlying data. Although our understanding of what types of features are captured by topological visualizations is good, our understanding of people's perception of those features is not. This paper evaluates the sensitivity of topology-based isocontour, Reeb graph, and persistence diagram visualizations compared to a reference color map visualization for synthetically generated scalar fields on 2-manifold triangular meshes embedded in 3D. In particular, we built and ran a human-subject study that evaluated the perception of data features characterized by Gaussian signals and measured how effectively each visualization technique portrays variations of data features arising from the position and amplitude variation of a mixture of Gaussians. For positional feature variations, the results showed that only the Reeb graph visualization had high sensitivity. For amplitude feature variations, persistence diagrams and color maps demonstrated the highest sensitivity, whereas isocontours showed only weak sensitivity. These results take an important step toward understanding which topology-based tools are best for various data and task scenarios and their effectiveness in conveying topological variations as compared to conventional color mapping.",A Comparative Study of the Perceptual Sensitivity of Topological Visualizations to Feature Variations,"Perception & cognition, computational topology-based techniques, comparison and similarity.",T&E,2023
"Tactile graphics are one of the best ways for a blind person to perceive a chart using touch, but their fabrication is often costly, time-consuming, and does not lend itself to dynamic exploration. Refreshable haptic displays tend to be expensive and thus unavailable to most blind individuals. We propose TactualPlot, an approach to sensory substitution where touch interaction yields auditory (sonified) feedback. The technique relies on embodied cognition for spatial awareness—i.e., individuals can perceive 2D touch locations of their fingers with reference to other 2D locations such as the relative locations of other fingers or chart characteristics that are visualized on touchscreens. Combining touch and sound in this way yields a scalable data exploration method for scatterplots where the data density under the user’s fingertips is sampled. The sample regions can optionally be scaled based on how quickly the user moves their hand. Our development of TactualPlot was informed by formative design sessions with a blind collaborator, whose practice while using tactile scatterplots caused us to expand the technique for multiple fingers. We present results from an evaluation comparing our TactualPlot interaction technique to tactile graphics printed on swell touch paper.",TactualPlot: Spatializing Data as Sound using Sensory Substitution for Touchscreen Accessibility,"Accessibility, sonification, multimodal interaction, crossmodal interaction, visualization",R&I,2023
"We present a hybrid multi-volume rendering approach based on a novel Residency Octree that combines the advantages of out-of-core volume rendering using page tables with those of standard octrees. Octree approaches work by performing hierarchical tree traversal. However, in octree volume rendering, tree traversal and the selection of data resolution are intrinsically coupled. This makes fine-grained empty-space skipping costly. Page tables, on the other hand, allow access to any cached brick from any resolution. However, they do not offer a clear and efficient strategy for substituting missing high-resolution data with lower-resolution data. We enable flexible mixed-resolution out-of-core multi-volume rendering by decoupling the cache residency of multi-resolution data from a resolution-independent spatial subdivision determined by the tree. Instead of one-to-one node-to-brick correspondences, each residency octree node is mapped to a set of bricks from different resolution levels. This makes it possible to efficiently and adaptively choose and mix resolutions, adapt sampling rates, and compensate for cache misses. At the same time, residency octrees support fine-grained empty-space skipping, independent of the data subdivision used for caching. Finally, to facilitate collaboration and outreach, and to eliminate local data storage, our implementation is a web-based, pure client-side renderer using WebGPU and WebAssembly. Our method is faster than prior approaches and efficient for many data channels with a flexible and adaptive choice of data resolution.",Residency Octree: A Hybrid Approach for Scalable Web-Based Multi-Volume Rendering,"Volume rendering, ray-guided rendering, large-scale data, out-of-core rendering, multi-resolution, multi-channel, web-based visualization",S&R,2023
"Recent advances in high-resolution connectomics provide researchers with access to accurate petascale reconstructions of neuronal circuits and brain networks for the first time. Neuroscientists are analyzing these networks to better understand information processing in the brain. In particular, scientists are interested in identifying specific small network motifs, i.e., repeating subgraphs of the larger brain network that are believed to be neuronal building blocks. Although such motifs are typically small (e.g., 2 -6 neurons), the vast data sizes and intricate data complexity present significant challenges to the search and analysis process. To analyze these motifs, it is crucial to review instances of a motif in the brain network and then map the graph structure to detailed 3D reconstructions of the involved neurons and synapses. We present Vimo, an interactive visual approach to analyze neuronal motifs and motif chains in large brain networks. Experts can sketch network motifs intuitively in a visual interface and specify structural properties of the involved neurons and synapses to query large connectomics datasets. Motif instances (MIs) can be explored in high-resolution 3D renderings. To simplify the analysis of MIs, we designed a continuous focus&context metaphor inspired by visual abstractions. This allows users to transition from a highly-detailed rendering of the anatomical structure to views that emphasize the underlying motif structure and synaptic connectivity. Furthermore, Vimo supports the identification of motif chains where a motif is used repeatedly (e.g., 2 -4 times) to form a larger network structure. We evaluate Vimo in a user study and an in-depth case study with seven domain experts on motifs in a large connectome of the fruit fly, including more than 21,000 neurons and 20 million synapses. We find that Vimo enables hypothesis generation and confirmation through fast analysis iterations and connectivity highlighting.",Vimo: Visual Analysis of Neuronal Connectivity Motifs,"Visual motif analysis, Focus&Context, Scientific visualization, Neuroscience, Connectomics.",App,2023
"Illustrative textures, such as stippling or hatching, were predominantly used as an alternative to conventional Phong rendering. Recently, the potential of encoding information on surfaces or maps using different densities has also been recognized. This has the significant advantage that additional color can be used as another visual channel and the illustrative textures can then be overlaid. Effectively, it is thus possible to display multiple information, such as two different scalar fields on surfaces simultaneously. In previous work, these textures were manually generated and the choice of density was unempirically determined. Here, we first want to determine and understand the perceptual space of illustrative textures. We chose a succession of simplices with increasing dimensions as primitives for our textures: Dots, lines, and triangles. Thus, we explore the texture types of stippling, hatching, and triangles. We create a range of textures by sampling the density space uniformly. Then, we conduct three perceptual studies in which the participants performed pairwise comparisons for each texture type. We use multidimensional scaling (MDS) to analyze the perceptual spaces per category. The perception of stippling and triangles seems relatively similar. Both are adequately described by a 1D manifold in 2D space. The perceptual space of hatching consists of two main clusters: Crosshatched textures, and textures with only one hatching direction. However, the perception of hatching textures with only one hatching direction is similar to the perception of stippling and triangles. Based on our findings, we construct perceptually uniform illustrative textures. Afterwards, we provide concrete application examples for the constructed textures.",Perceptually Uniform Construction of Illustrative Textures,"Illustrative Visualization, Perceptual Evaluation, Hatching, Stippling.",T&E,2023
"Open-world object detection (OWOD) is an emerging computer vision problem that involves not only the identification of predefined object classes, like what general object detectors do, but also detects new unknown objects simultaneously. Recently, several end-to-end deep learning models have been proposed to address the OWOD problem. However, these approaches face several challenges: a) significant changes in both network architecture and training procedure are required; b) they are trained from scratch, which can not leverage existing pre-trained general detectors; c) costly annotations for all unknown classes are needed. To overcome these challenges, we present a visual analytic framework called OW-Adapter. It acts as an adaptor to enable pre-trained general object detectors to handle the OWOD problem. Specifically, OW-Adapter is designed to identify, summarize, and annotate unknown examples with minimal human effort. Moreover, we introduce a lightweight classifier to learn newly annotated unknown classes and plug the classifier into pre-trained general detectors to detect unknown objects. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through two case studies of different domains, including common object recognition and autonomous driving. The studies show that a simple yet powerful adaptor can extend the capability of pre-trained general detectors to detect unknown objects and improve the performance on known classes simultaneously.",OW-Adapter: Human-Assisted Open-World Object Detection with a Few Examples,"Open world learning, object detection, continuous learning, human-assisted AI.",A&D,2023
"Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are ubiquitous in cutting-edge physio-chemical research. They provide critical insights into how a physical system evolves over time given a model of interatomic interactions. Understanding a system’s evolution is key to selecting the best candidates for new drugs, materials for manufacturing, and countless other practical applications. With today’s technology, these simulations can encompass millions of unit transitions between discrete molecular structures, spanning up to several milliseconds of real time. Attempting to perform a brute-force analysis with data-sets of this size is not only computationally impractical, but would not shed light on the physically-relevant features of the data. Moreover, there is a need to analyze simulation ensembles in order to compare similar processes in differing environments. These problems call for an approach that is analytically transparent, computationally efficient, and flexible enough to handle the variety found in materials-based research. In order to address these problems, we introduce MolSieve, a progressive visual analytics system that enables the comparison of multiple long-duration simulations. Using MolSieve, analysts are able to quickly identify and compare regions of interest within immense simulations through its combination of control charts, data-reduction techniques, and highly informative visual components. A simple programming interface is provided which allows experts to fit MolSieve to their needs. To demonstrate the efficacy of our approach, we present two case studies of MolSieve and report on findings from domain collaborators.",MolSieve: A Progressive Visual Analytics System for Molecular Dynamics Simulations,"Molecular dynamics, time-series analysis, visual analytics",App,2023
"Volume data is commonly found in many scientific disciplines, like medicine, physics, and biology. Experts rely on robust scientific visualization techniques to extract valuable insights from the data. Recent years have shown path tracing to be the preferred approach for volumetric rendering, given its high levels of realism. However, real-time volumetric path tracing often suffers from stochastic noise and long convergence times, limiting interactive exploration. In this paper, we present a novel method to enable real-time global illumination for volume data visualization. We develop Photon Field Networks - a phase-function-aware, multi-light neural representation of indirect volumetric global illumination. The fields are trained on multi-phase photon caches that we compute a priori. Training can be done within seconds, after which the fields can be used in various rendering tasks. To showcase their potential, we develop a custom neural path tracer, with which our photon fields achieve interactive framerates even on large datasets. We conduct in-depth evaluations of the method's performance, including visual quality, stochastic noise, inference and rendering speeds, and accuracy regarding illumination and phase function awareness. Results are compared to ray marching, path tracing and photon mapping. Our findings show that Photon Field Networks can faithfully represent indirect global illumination within the boundaries of the trained phase spectrum while exhibiting less stochastic noise and rendering at a significantly faster rate than traditional methods.",Photon Field Networks for Dynamic Real-Time Volumetric Global Illumination,"Volume data, volume rendering, volume visualization, deep learning, global illumination, neural rendering, path tracing",S&R,2023

Specifically, we leverage neural rendering to learn a latent design space, which is a continuous manifold representing various types of implicit transfer functions. We further provide a set of interactive tools to support intuitive query, navigation, and modification to obtain the target design, which is represented as a neural-rendered design exemplar. The explicit transfer function can be reconstructed from the target design with a differentiable direct volume renderer.

"The exploratory visual analysis (EVA) of time series data uses visualization as the main output medium and input interface for exploring new data. However, for users who lack visual analysis expertise, interpreting and manipulating EVA can be challenging. Thus, providing guidance on EVA is necessary and two relevant questions need to be answered. First, how to recommend interesting insights to provide a first glance at data and help develop an exploration goal. Second, how to provide step-by-step EVA suggestions to help identify which parts of the data to explore. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning (RL)-based system, Visail, which generates EVA sequences to guide the exploration of time series data. As a user uploads a time series dataset, Visail can generate step-by-step EVA suggestions, while each step is visualized as an annotated chart combined with textual descriptions. The RL-based algorithm uses exploratory data analysis knowledge to construct the state and action spaces for the agent to imitate human analysis behaviors in data exploration tasks. In this way, the agent learns the strategy of generating coherent EVA sequences through a well-designed network. To evaluate the effectiveness of our system, we conducted an ablation study, a user study, and two case studies.

"Data features and class probabilities are two main perspectives when, e.g., evaluating model results and identifying problematic items. Class probabilities represent the likelihood that each instance belongs to a particular class, which can be produced by probabilistic classifiers or even human labeling with uncertainty. Since both perspectives are multi-dimensional data, dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques are commonly used to extract informative characteristics from them. However, existing methods either focus solely on the data feature perspective or rely on class probability estimates to guide the DR process. In contrast to previous work where separate views are linked to conduct the analysis, we propose a novel approach, class-constrained t-SNE, that combines data features and class probabilities in the same DR result. Specifically, we combine them by balancing two corresponding components in a cost function to optimize the positions of data points and iconic representation of classes -- class landmarks. Furthermore, an interactive user-adjustable parameter balances these two components so that users can focus on the weighted perspectives of interest and also empowers a smooth visual transition between varying perspectives to preserve the mental map. We illustrate its application potential in model evaluation and visual-interactive labeling.

"While we typically focus on data visualization as a tool for facilitating cognitive tasks (e.g.\ learning facts, making decisions), we know relatively little about their second-order impacts on our opinions, attitudes, and values. For example, could design or framing choices interact with viewers' social cognitive biases in ways that promote political polarization? When reporting on U.S. attitudes toward public policies, it is popular to highlight the gap between Democrats and Republicans (e.g.\ with blue vs red connected dot plots). But these charts may encourage social-normative conformity, influencing viewers' attitudes to match the divided opinions shown in the visualization. We conducted three experiments examining visualization framing in the context of social conformity and polarization. Crowdworkers viewed charts showing simulated polling results for public policy proposals. We varied framing (aggregating data as non-partisan “All US Adults,” or partisan “Democrat” / “Republican”) and the visualized groups' support levels. Participants then reported their own support for each policy. We found that participants' attitudes biased significantly toward the group attitudes shown in the stimuli and this can increase inter-party attitude divergence.These results demonstrate that data visualizations can induce social conformity and accelerate political polarization. Choosing to visualize partisan divisions can divide us further.",Polarizing Political Polls: Visualization Design Choices Can Shape Public Opinion and Increase Political Polarization,"Political Polarization, Public Opinion, Social Categorization, Survey Data, Social Influence, Attitude Change",T&E,2023
"Guidance can support users during the exploration and analysis of complex data. Previous research focused on characterizing the theoretical aspects of guidance in visual analytics and implementing guidance in different scenarios. However, the evaluation of guidance-enhanced visual analytics solutions remains an open research question. We tackle this question by introducing and validating a practical evaluation methodology for guidance in visual analytics. We identify eight quality criteria to be fulfilled and collect expert feedback on their validity. To facilitate actual evaluation studies, we derive two sets of heuristics. The first set targets heuristic evaluations conducted by expert evaluators. The second set facilitates end-user studies where participants actually use a guidance-enhanced system. By following such a dual approach, the different quality criteria of guidance can be examined from two different perspectives, enhancing the overall value of evaluation studies. To test the practical utility of our methodology, we employ it in two studies to gain insight into the quality of two guidance-enhanced visual analytics solutions, one being a work-in-progress research prototype, and the other being a publicly available visualization recommender system. Based on these two evaluations, we derive good practices for conducting evaluations of guidance in visual analytics and identify pitfalls to be avoided during such studies.",A Heuristic Approach for Dual Expert/End-User Evaluation of Guidance in Visual Analytics,"Guidance, heuristics, evaluation, visual analytics.",T&E,2023

The key idea behind our method is to formulate both discrete and continuous predictions in different tasks as unified probability distributions. Based on these distributions, we develop 1) a matrix-based visualization to provide an overview of model performance; 2) a table visualization to identify the problematic data subsets where the model performs poorly; 3) a grid visualization to display the samples of interest. These visualizations work together to facilitate the model evaluation from a global overview to individual samples.

"Neural networks attract significant attention in almost every field due to their widespread applications in various tasks. However, developers often struggle with debugging due to the black-box nature of neural networks. Visual analytics provides an intuitive way for developers to understand the hidden states and underlying complex transformations in neural networks.

However, these approaches are often architecture-specific with strong assumptions of how the network should be understood. This limits their use when the network architecture or the exploration goal changes.

"Orbifolds are a modern mathematical concept that arises in the research of hyperbolic geometry with applications in computer graphics and visualization. In this paper, we make use of rooms with mirrors as the visual metaphor for orbifolds.

This polygon is then used to create a room for which the polygon serves as the floor and the ceiling.

"Recent work has shown that when both the chart and caption emphasize the same aspects of the data, readers tend to remember the doubly-emphasized features as takeaways; when there is a mismatch, readers rely on the chart to form takeaways and can miss information in the caption text. Through a survey of 280 chart-caption pairs in real-world sources (e.g., news media, poll reports, government reports, academic articles, and Tableau Public), we find that captions often do not emphasize the same information in practice, which could limit how effectively readers take away the authors’ intended messages. Motivated by the survey findings, we present EmphasisChecker, an interactive tool that highlights visually prominent chart features as well as the features emphasized by the caption text along with any mismatches in the emphasis. The tool implements a time-series prominent feature detector based on the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm and a text reference extractor that identifies time references and data descriptions in the caption and matches them with chart data. This information enables authors to compare features emphasized by these two modalities, quickly see mismatches, and make necessary revisions.

"Deep learning (DL) approaches are being increasingly used for time-series forecasting, with many efforts devoted to designing complex DL models. Recent studies have shown that the DL success is often attributed to effective data representations, fostering the fields of feature engineering and representation learning. However, automated approaches for feature learning are typically limited with respect to incorporating prior knowledge, identifying interactions among variables, and choosing evaluation metrics to ensure that the models are reliable. To improve on these limitations, this paper contributes a novel visual analytics framework, namely TimeTuner, designed to help analysts understand how model behaviors are associated with localized correlations, stationarity, and granularity of time-series representations. The system mainly consists of the following two-stage technique: We first leverage counterfactual explanations to connect the relationships among time-series representations, multivariate features and model predictions. Next, we design multiple coordinated views including a partition-based correlation matrix and juxtaposed bivariate stripes, and provide a set of interactions that allow users to step into the transformation selection process, navigate through the feature space, and reason the model performance. We instantiate TimeTuner with two transformation methods of smoothing and sampling, and demonstrate its applicability on real-world time-series forecasting of univariate sunspots and multivariate air pollutants.

"We present a multi-dimensional, multi-level, and multi-channel approach to data visualization for the purpose of constructive climate journalism. Data visualization has assumed a central role in environmental journalism and is often used in data stories to convey the dramatic consequences of climate change and other ecological crises. However, the emphasis on the catastrophic impacts of climate change tends to induce feelings of fear, anxiety, and apathy in readers. Climate mitigation, adaptation, and protection – all highly urgent in the face of the climate crisis – are at risk of being overlooked. These topics are more difficult to communicate as they are hard to convey on varying levels of locality, involve multiple interconnected sectors, and need to be mediated across various channels from the printed newspaper to social media platforms. So far, there has been little research on data visualization to enhance affective engagement with data about climate protection as part of solution-oriented reporting of climate change. With this research we characterize the unique challenges of constructive climate journalism for data visualization and share findings from a research and design study in collaboration with a national newspaper in Germany. Using the affordances and aesthetics of travel postcards, we present Klimakarten, a data journalism project on the progress of climate protection at multiple spatial scales (from national to local), across five key sectors (agriculture, buildings, energy, mobility, and waste), and for print and online use. The findings from quantitative and qualitative analysis of reader feedback confirm our overall approach and suggest implications for future work.",From shock to shift: Data visualization for constructive climate journalism,"Constructive Climate Journalism, Frameworks, Storytelling, Journalism",App,2023
"In recent years, more and more researchers have reflected on the undervaluation of emotion in data visualization and highlighted the importance of considering human emotion in visualization design. Meanwhile, an increasing number of studies have been conducted to explore emotion-related factors. However, so far, this research area is still in its early stages and faces a set of challenges, such as the unclear definition of key concepts, the insufficient justification of why emotion is important in visualization design, and the lack of characterization of the design space of affective visualization design. To address these challenges, first, we conducted a literature review and identified three research lines that examined both emotion and data visualization. We clarified the differences between these research lines and kept 109 papers that studied or discussed how data visualization communicates and influences emotion. Then, we coded the 109 papers in terms of how they justified the legitimacy of considering emotion in visualization design (i.e., why emotion is important) and identified five argumentative perspectives. Based on these papers, we also identified 61 projects that practiced affective visualization design. We coded these design projects in three dimensions, including design fields (where), design tasks (what), and design methods (how), to explore the design space of affective visualization design.",Affective Visualization Design: Leveraging the Emotional Impact of Data,Information Visualization;Affective Design;Visual Communication;User Experience;Storytelling,T&E,2023
"Draco has been developed as an automated visualization recommendation system formalizing design knowledge as logical constraints in ASP (Answer-Set Programming). With an increasing set of constraints and incorporated design knowledge, even visualization experts lose overview in Draco and struggle to retrace the automated recommendation decisions made by the system. Our paper proposes an Visual Analytics (VA) approach to visualize and analyze Draco's constraints. Our VA approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to accomplish identified tasks regarding the knowledge base and support them in better understanding Draco. We extend the existing data extraction strategy of Draco with a data processing architecture capable of extracting features of interest from the knowledge base. A revised version of the ASP grammar provides the basis for this data processing strategy. The resulting incorporated and shared features of the constraints are then visualized using a hypergraph structure inside the radial-arranged constraints of the elaborated visualization. The hierarchical categories of the constraints are indicated by arcs surrounding the constraints. Our approach is supposed to enable visualization experts to interactively explore the design rules' violations based on highlighting respective constraints or recommendations. A qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the prototype confirms the prototype's effectiveness and value in acquiring insights into Draco's recommendation process and design constraints.",Visual Analytics for Understanding Draco's Knowledge Base,"Visual Analytics, Hypergraph visualization, Rule-based recommendation systems",App,2023
"This study presents insights from interviews with nineteen Knowledge Graph (KG) practitioners who work in both enterprise and academic settings on a wide variety of use cases. Through this study, we identify critical challenges experienced by KG practitioners when creating, exploring, and analyzing KGs that could be alleviated through visualization design. Our findings reveal three major personas among KG practitioners -- KG Builders, Analysts, and Consumers -- each of whom have their own distinct expertise and needs. We discover that KG Builders would benefit from schema enforcers, while KG Analysts need customizable query builders that provide interim query results. For KG Consumers, we identify a lack of efficacy for node-link diagrams, and the need for tailored domain-specific visualizations to promote KG adoption and comprehension. Lastly, we find that implementing KGs effectively in practice requires both technical and social solutions that are not addressed with current tools, technologies, and collaborative workflows. From the analysis of our interviews, we distill several visualization research directions to improve KG usability, including knowledge cards that balance digestibility and discoverability, timeline views to track temporal changes, interfaces that support organic discovery, and semantic explanations for AI and machine learning predictions.","Knowledge Graphs in Practice: Characterizing their Users, Challenges, and Visualization Opportunities","Knowledge graphs, visualization techniques and methodologies, human factors, visual communication",T&E,2023
"While cities around the world are looking for smart ways to use new advances in data collection, management, and analysis to address their problems, the complex nature of urban issues and the overwhelming amount of available data have posed significant challenges in translating these efforts into actionable insights. In the past few years, urban visual analytics tools have significantly helped tackle these challenges. When analyzing a feature of interest, an urban expert must transform, integrate, and visualize different thematic (e.g., sunlight access, demographic) and physical (e.g., buildings, street networks) data layers, oftentimes across multiple spatial and temporal scales. However, integrating and analyzing these layers require expertise in different fields, increasing development time and effort. This makes the entire visual data exploration and system implementation difficult for programmers and also sets a high entry barrier for urban experts outside of computer science. With this in mind, in this paper, we present the Urban Toolkit (UTK), a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind. In order to facilitate the integration and visualization of different urban data, we also propose the concept of knots to merge thematic and physical urban layers. We evaluate our approach through use cases and a series of interviews with experts and practitioners from different domains, including urban accessibility, urban planning, architecture, and climate science.

"Visual data stories can effectively convey insights from data, yet their creation often necessitates intricate data exploration, insight discovery, narrative organization, and customization to meet the communication objectives of the storyteller. Existing automated data storytelling system, however, tends to overlook the importance of user customization during the data story authoring process, limiting the system's ability to create tailored narratives that reflect the user's intentions. We present a novel data story generation workflow that leverages adaptive machine-guided elicitation of user feedback to customize the story. Our approach employs an adaptive plug-in module for existing story generation systems, which incorporates user feedback through interactive questioning based on the conversation history and dataset. This adaptability refines the system's understanding of the user's intentions, ensuring the final narrative aligns with their goals. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach through the implementation of an interactive prototype: Socrates. Through a quantitative user study with 18 participants that compares our method to a state-of-the-art data story generation algorithm, we show that Socrates produces more relevant stories with a larger overlap of insights compared to human-generated stories. We also demonstrate the usability of Socrates via interviews with three data analysts and highlight areas of future work.",Socrates: Data Story Generation via Adaptive Machine-Guided Elicitation of User Feedback,"Narrative visualization, visual storytelling, conversational agent",A&D,2023
"Evolutionary multi-objective optimization (EMO) algorithms have been demonstrated to be effective in solving multi-criteria decision-making problems. In real-world applications, analysts often employ several algorithms concurrently and compare their solution sets to gain insight into the characteristics of different algorithms and explore a broader range of feasible solutions. However, EMO algorithms are typically treated as black boxes, leading to difficulties in performing detailed analysis and comparisons between the internal evolutionary processes. Inspired by the successful application of visual analytics tools in explainable AI, we argue that interactive visualization can significantly enhance the comparative analysis between multiple EMO algorithms. In this paper, we present a visual analytics framework that enables the exploration and comparison of evolutionary processes in EMO algorithms. Guided by a literature review and expert interviews, the proposed framework addresses various analytical tasks and establishes a multi-faceted visualization design to support the comparative analysis of intermediate generations in the evolution as well as solution sets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through case studies on benchmarking and real-world multi-objective optimization problems to elucidate how analysts can leverage our framework to inspect and compare diverse algorithms.",A Comparative Visual Analytics Framework for Evaluating Evolutionary Processes in Multi-objective Optimization,"Visual analytics, evolutionary multi-objective optimization",App,2023
"We investigate variability overweighting, a previously undocumented bias in line graphs, where estimates of average value are biased toward areas of higher variability in that line. We found this effect across two preregistered experiments with 140 and 420 participants. These experiments also show that the bias is reduced when using a dot encoding of the same series. We can model the bias with the average of the data series and the average of the points drawn along the line. This bias might arise because higher variability leads to stronger weighting in the average calculation, either due to the longer line segments (even though those segments contain the same number of data values) or line segments with higher variability being otherwise more visually salient. Understanding and predicting this bias is important for visualization design guidelines, recommendation systems, and tool builders, as the bias can adversely affect estimates of averages and trends.",Average Estimates in Line Graphs are Biased Towards Areas of Higher Variability,"bias, lines graph, ensemble perception, average",T&E,2023
"Recently, large pretrained language models have achieved compelling performance on commonsense benchmarks. Nevertheless, it is unclear what commonsense knowledge the models learn and whether they solely exploit spurious patterns. Feature attributions are popular explainability techniques that identify important input concepts for model outputs. However, commonsense knowledge tends to be implicit and rarely explicitly presented in inputs. These methods cannot infer models’ implicit reasoning over mentioned concepts. We present CommonsenseVIS, a visual explanatory system that utilizes external commonsense knowledge bases to contextualize model behavior for commonsense question-answering. Specifically, we extract relevant commonsense knowledge in inputs as references to align model behavior with human knowledge. Our system features multi-level visualization and interactive model probing and editing for different concepts and their underlying relations. Through a user study, we show that CommonsenseVIS helps NLP experts conduct a systematic and scalable visual analysis of models’ relational reasoning over concepts in different situations.",CommonsenseVIS: Visualizing and Understanding Commonsense Reasoning Capabilities of Natural Language Models,"Commonsense reasoning, visual analytics, XAI, natural language processing",A&D,2023
"Personalized head and neck cancer therapeutics have greatly improved survival rates for patients, but are often leading to understudied long-lasting symptoms which affect quality of life. Sequential rule mining (SRM) is a promising unsupervised machine learning method for predicting longitudinal patterns in temporal data which, however, can output many repetitive patterns that are difficult to interpret without the assistance of visual analytics. We present a data-driven, human-machine analysis visual system developed in collaboration with SRM model builders in cancer symptom research, which facilitates mechanistic knowledge discovery in large scale, multivariate cohort symptom data. Our system supports multivariate predictive modeling of post-treatment symptoms based on during-treatment symptoms. It supports this goal through an SRM, clustering, and aggregation back end, and a custom front end to help develop and tune the predictive models. The system also explains the resulting predictions in the context of therapeutic decisions typical in personalized care delivery. We evaluate the resulting models and system with an interdisciplinary group of modelers and head and neck oncology researchers.

"We developed a new approach comprised of different visualizations for the comparative spatio-temporal analysis of displacement processes in porous media. We aim to analyze and compare ensemble datasets from experiments to gain insight into the influence of different parameters on fluid flow. To capture the displacement of a defending fluid by an invading fluid, we first condense an input image series to a single time map. From this map, we generate a spatio-temporal flow graph covering the whole process. This graph is further simplified to only reflect topological changes in the movement of the invading fluid. Our interactive tools allow the visual analysis of these processes by visualizing the graph structure and the context of the experimental setup, as well as by providing charts for multiple metrics. We apply our approach to analyze and compare ensemble datasets jointly with domain experts, where we vary either fluid properties or the solid structure of the porous medium. We finally report the generated insights from the domain experts and discuss our contribution’s advantages, generality, and limitations.",Visual Analysis of Displacement Processes in Porous Media using Spatio-Temporal Flow Graphs,"Comparative visualization, ensemble, graph, porous media.",App,2023
"The concept of augmented reality (AR) assistants has captured the human imagination for decades, becoming a staple of modern science fiction. To pursue this goal, it is necessary to develop artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods that simultaneously perceive the 3D environment, reason about physical tasks, and model the performer, all in real-time. Within this framework, a wide variety of sensors are needed to generate data across different modalities, such as audio, video, depth, speech, and time-of-flight. The required sensors are typically part of the AR headset, providing performer sensing and interaction through visual, audio, and haptic feedback. AI assistants not only record the performer as they perform activities, but also require machine learning (ML) models to understand and assist the performer as they interact with the physical world. Therefore, developing such assistants is a challenging task. We propose ARGUS, a visual analytics system to support the development of intelligent AR assistants. Our system was designed as part of a multi-year-long collaboration between visualization researchers and ML and AR experts. This co-design process has led to advances in the visualization of ML in AR. Our system allows for online visualization of object, action, and step detection as well as offline analysis of previously recorded AR sessions. It visualizes not only the multimodal sensor data streams but also the output of the ML models. This allows developers to gain insights into the performer activities as well as the ML models, helping them troubleshoot, improve, and fine-tune the components of the AR assistant.",ARGUS: Visualization of AI-assisted Task Guidance in AR,Data Models; Image and Video Data; Temporal Data; Application Motivated Visualization; AR/VR/Immersive.,App,2023
"Situated visualization has become an increasingly popular research area in the visualization community, fueled by advancements in augmented reality (AR) technology and immersive analytics. Visualizing data in spatial proximity to their physical referents affords new design opportunities and considerations not present in traditional visualization, which researchers are now beginning to explore. However, the AR research community has an extensive history of designing graphics that are displayed in highly physical contexts. In this work, we leverage the richness of AR research and apply it to situated visualization. We derive design patterns which summarize common approaches of visualizing data in situ. The design patterns are based on a survey of 293 papers published in the AR and visualization communities, as well as our own expertise. We discuss design dimensions that help to describe both our patterns and previous work in the literature. This discussion is accompanied by several guidelines which explain how to apply the patterns given the constraints imposed by the real world. We conclude by discussing future research directions that will help establish a complete understanding of the design of situated visualization, including the role of interactivity, tasks, and workflows.",Design Patterns for Situated Visualization in Augmented Reality,"Augmented reality, immersive analytics, situated visualization, design patterns, design space",T&E,2023
"A visualization notation is a recurring pattern of symbols used to author specifications of visualizations, from data transformation to visual mapping. Programmatic notations use symbols defined by grammars or domain-specific languages (e.g., ggplot2, dplyr, Vega-Lite) or libraries (e.g., Matplotlib, Pandas).   Designers and prospective users of grammars and libraries often evaluate visualization notations by inspecting galleries of examples.  While such collections demonstrate usage and expressiveness, their construction and evaluation are usually ad hoc, making comparisons of different notations difficult.  More rarely, experts analyze notations via usability heuristics, such as the Cognitive Dimensions of Notations framework. These analyses, akin to structured close readings of text, can reveal design deficiencies, but place a burden on the expert to simultaneously consider many facets of often complex systems.  To alleviate these issues, we introduce a metrics-based approach to usability evaluation and comparison of notations in which metrics are computed for a gallery of examples across a suite of notations.  While applicable to any visualization domain, we explore the utility of our approach via a case study considering statistical graphics that explores 40 visualizations across 9 widely used notations. We facilitate the computation of appropriate metrics and analysis via a new tool called NotaScope.  We gathered feedback via interviews with authors or maintainers of prominent charting libraries  (n=6).  We find that this approach is a promising way to formalize, externalize, and extend evaluations and comparisons of visualization notations.",Metrics-Based Evaluation and Comparison of Visualization Notations,"Notation, Usability, Evaluation, Language design, API design, Domain-specific languages.",T&E,2023
"Exploration and analysis of high-dimensional data are important tasks in many fields that produce large and complex data, like the financial sector, systems biology, or cultural heritage. Tailor-made visual analytics software is developed for each specific application, limiting their applicability in other fields. However, as diverse as these fields are, their characteristics and requirements for data analysis are conceptually similar. Many applications share abstract tasks and data types and are often constructed with similar building blocks. Developing such applications, even when based mostly on existing building blocks, requires significant engineering efforts. We developed ManiVault, a flexible and extensible open-source visual analytics framework for analyzing high-dimensional data. The primary objective of ManiVault is to facilitate rapid prototyping of visual analytics workflows for visualization software developers and practitioners alike. ManiVault is built using a plugin-based architecture that offers easy extensibility. While our architecture deliberately keeps plugins self-contained, to guarantee maximum flexibility and re-usability, we have designed and implemented a messaging API for tight integration and linking of modules to support common visual analytics design patterns. We provide several visualization and analytics plugins, and ManiVault's API makes the integration of new plugins easy for developers. ManiVault facilitates the distribution of visualization and analysis pipelines and results for practitioners through saving and reproducing complete application states. As such, ManiVault can be used as a communication tool among researchers to discuss workflows and results.

"Timelines are essential for visually communicating chronological narratives and reflecting on the personal and cultural significance of historical events. Existing visualization tools tend to support conventional linear representations, but fail to capture personal idiosyncratic conceptualizations of time. In response, we built TimeSplines, a visualization authoring tool that allows people to sketch multiple free-form temporal axes and populate them with heterogeneous, time-oriented data via incremental and lazy data binding. Authors can bend, compress, and expand temporal axes to emphasize or de-emphasize intervals based on their personal importance; they can also annotate the axes with text and figurative elements to convey contextual information. The results of two user studies show how people appropriate the concepts in TimeSplines to express their own conceptualization of time, while our curated gallery of images demonstrates the expressive potential of our approach.",TimeSplines: Sketch-based Authoring of Flexible and Idiosyncratic Timelines,"Temporal Data, interaction design, communication / presentation, storytelling, sketch-based interface, lazy data binding",R&I,2023
"Hairpin vortices are one of the most important vortical structures in turbulent flows. Extracting and characterizing hairpin vortices provides useful insight into many behaviors in turbulent flows. However, hairpin vortices have complex configurations and might be entangled with other vortices, making their extraction difficult. In this work, we introduce a framework to extract and separate hairpin vortices in shear driven turbulent flows for their study. Our method first extracts general vortical regions with a region-growing strategy based on certain vortex criteria (e.g., λ2) and then separates those vortices with the help of progressive extraction of (λ2) iso-surfaces in a top-down fashion. This leads to a hierarchical tree representing the spatial proximity and merging relation of vortices. After separating individual vortices, their shape and orientation information is extracted. Candidate hairpin vortices are identified based on their shape and orientation information as well as their physical characteristics. An interactive visualization system is developed to aid the exploration, classification, and analysis of hairpin vortices based on their geometric and physical attributes. We also present additional use cases of the proposed system for the analysis and study of general vortices in other types of flows.",Extract and Characterize Hairpin Vortices in Turbulent Flows,"Turbulent flow, vortices, hairpin vortex extraction",App,2023
"Distributed query processing systems such as Apache Hive and Spark are widely-used in many organizations for large-scale data analytics. Analyzing and understanding the query execution process of these systems are daily routines for engineers and crucial for identifying performance problems, optimizing system configurations, and rectifying errors. However, existing visualization tools for distributed query execution are insufficient because (i) most of them (if not all) do not provide fine-grained visualization (i.e., the atomic task level), which can be crucial for understanding query performance and reasoning about the underlying execution anomalies, and (ii) they do not support proper linkages between system status and query execution, which makes it difficult to identify the causes of execution problems. To tackle these limitations, we propose QEVIS, which visualizes distributed query execution process with multiple views that focus on different granularities and complement each other. Specifically, we first devise a query logical plan layout algorithm to visualize the overall query execution progress compactly and clearly. We then propose two novel scoring methods to summarize the anomaly degrees of the jobs and machines during query execution, and visualize the anomaly scores intuitively, which allow users to easily identify the components that are worth paying attention to. Moreover, we devise a scatter plot-based task view to show a massive number of atomic tasks, where task distribution patterns are informative for execution problems. We also equip QEVIS with a suite of auxiliary views and interaction methods to support easy and effective cross-view exploration, which makes it convenient to track the causes of execution problems.

"Simulation-based Medical Education (SBME) has been developed as a cost-effective means of enhancing the diagnostic skills of novice physicians and interns, thereby mitigating the need for resource-intensive mentor-apprentice training. However, feedback provided in most SBME is often directed towards improving the operational proficiency of learners, rather than providing summative medical diagnoses that result from experience and time. Additionally, the multimodal nature of medical data during diagnosis poses significant challenges for interns and novice physicians, including the tendency to overlook or over-rely on data from certain modalities, and difficulties in comprehending potential associations between modalities. To address these challenges, we present DiagnosisAssistant, a visual analytics system that leverages historical medical records as a proxy for multimodal modeling and visualization to enhance the learning experience of interns and novice physicians. The system employs elaborately designed visualizations to explore different modality data, offer diagnostic interpretive hints based on the constructed model, and enable comparative analyses of specific patients.

"Scene representation networks (SRNs) have been recently proposed for compression and visualization of scientific data. However, state-of-the-art SRNs do not adapt the allocation of available network parameters to the complex features found in scientific data, leading to a loss in reconstruction quality. We address this shortcoming with an adaptively placed multi-grid SRN (APMGSRN) and propose a domain decomposition training and inference technique for accelerated parallel training on multi-GPU systems. We also release an open-source neural volume rendering application that allows plug-and-play rendering with any PyTorch-based SRN. Our proposed APMGSRN architecture uses multiple spatially adaptive feature grids that learn where to be placed within the domain to dynamically allocate more neural network resources where error is high in the volume, improving state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy of SRNs for scientific data without requiring expensive octree refining, pruning, and traversal like previous adaptive models. In our domain decomposition approach for representing large-scale data, we train an set of APMGSRNs in parallel on separate bricks of the volume to reduce training time while avoiding overhead necessary for an out-of-core solution for volumes too large to fit in GPU memory. After training, the lightweight SRNs are used for realtime neural volume rendering in our open-source renderer, where arbitrary view angles and transfer functions can be explored.

Our work contributes to multiple ongoing discussions on the ethical implications of data visualizations. By choosing specifc data, visual variables, and text labels, visualization designers may, inadvertently or not, perpetuate stereotypes and biases. Here, our goal is to start an evolving discussion on how to represent data on gender in data visualizations and raise awareness of the subtleties of choosing visual variables and words in gender visualizations. In order to ground this discussion, we collected and coded gender visualizations and their captions from fve different scientifc communities (Biology, Politics, Social Studies, Visualisation, and Human-Computer Interaction), in addition to images from Tableau Public and the Information Is Beautiful awards showcase.

"We propose three novel spatial data selection techniques for particle data in VR visualization environments. They are designed to be target- and context-aware and be suitable for a wide range of data features and complex scenarios. Each technique is designed to be adjusted to particular selection intents: the selection of consecutive dense regions, the selection of filament-like structures, and the selection of clusters—with all of them facilitating post-selection threshold adjustment. These techniques allow users to precisely select those regions of space for further exploration—with simple and approximate 3D pointing, brushing, or drawing input—using flexible point- or path-based input and without being limited by 3D occlusions, non-homogeneous feature density, or complex data shapes. These new techniques are evaluated in a controlled experiment and compared with the Baseline method, a region-based 3D painting selection. Our results indicate that our techniques are effective in handling a wide range of scenarios and allow users to select data based on their comprehension of crucial features. Furthermore, we analyze the attributes, requirements, and strategies of our spatial selection methods and compare them with existing state-of-the-art selection methods to handle diverse data features and situations.

"Although visualization tools are widely available and accessible, not everyone knows the best practices and guidelines for creating accurate and honest visual representations of data. Numerous books and articles have been written to expose the misleading potential of poorly constructed charts and teach people how to avoid being deceived by them or making their own mistakes. These readings use various rhetorical devices to explain the concepts to their readers. In our analysis of a collection of books, online materials, and a design workshop, we identified six common explanation methods. To assess the effectiveness of these methods, we conducted two crowdsourced studies (each with N = 125) to evaluate their ability to teach and persuade people to make design changes. In addition to these existing methods, we brought in the idea of Explorable Explanations, which allows readers to experiment with different chart settings and observe how the changes are reflected in the visualization. While we did not find significant differences across explanation methods, the results of our experiments indicate that, following the exposure to the explanations, the participants showed improved proficiency in identifying deceptive charts and were more receptive to proposed alterations of the visualization design. We discovered that participants were willing to accept more than 60% of the proposed adjustments in the persuasiveness assessment. Nevertheless, we found no significant differences among different explanation methods in convincing participants to accept the modifications.",Why Change My Design: Explaining Poorly Constructed Visualization Designs with Explorable Explanations,"Information Visualization, Deceptive Visualization, Explorable Explanations",T&E,2023
"Quantum computing is a rapidly evolving field that enables exponential speed-up over classical algorithms. At the heart of this revolutionary technology are quantum circuits, which serve as vital tools for implementing, analyzing, and optimizing quantum algorithms. Recent advancements in quantum computing and the increasing capability of quantum devices have led to the development of more complex quantum circuits. However, traditional quantum circuit diagrams suffer from scalability and readability issues, which limit the efficiency of analysis and optimization processes. In this research, we propose a novel visualization approach for large-scale quantum circuits by adopting semantic analysis to facilitate the comprehension of quantum circuits. We first exploit meta-data and semantic information extracted from the underlying code of quantum circuits to create component segmentations and pattern abstractions, allowing for easier wrangling of massive circuit diagrams. We then develop Quantivine, an interactive system for exploring and understanding quantum circuits.

"A common way to evaluate the reliability of dimensionality reduction (DR) embeddings is to quantify how well labeled classes form compact, mutually separated clusters in the embeddings. This approach is based on the assumption that the classes stay as clear clusters in the original high-dimensional space. However, in reality, this assumption can be violated; a single class can be fragmented into multiple separated clusters, and multiple classes can be merged into a single cluster. We thus cannot always assure the credibility of the evaluation using class labels. In this paper, we introduce two novel quality measures—Label-Trustworthiness and Label-Continuity (Label-T&C)—advancing the process of DR evaluation based on class labels. Instead of assuming that classes are well-clustered in the original space, Label-T&C work by (1) estimating the extent to which classes form clusters in the original and embedded spaces and (2) evaluating the difference between the two. A quantitative evaluation showed that Label-T&C outperform widely used DR evaluation measures (e.g., Trustworthiness and Continuity, Kullback-Leibler divergence) in terms of the accuracy in assessing how well DR embeddings preserve the cluster structure, and are also scalable. Moreover, we present case studies demonstrating that Label-T&C can be successfully used for revealing the intrinsic characteristics of DR techniques and their hyperparameters.",Classes are not Clusters: Improving Label-based Evaluation of Dimensionality Reduction,"Dimensionality Reduction, Reliability, Clustering, Clustering Validation Measures, Dimensionality Reduction Evaluation",DTr,2023
"Despite an abundance of open data initiatives aimed to inform and empower “general” audiences, we still know little about the ways people outside of traditional data analysis communities experience and engage with public data and visualizations. To investigate this gap, we present results from an in-depth qualitative interview study with 19 participants from diverse ethnic, occupational, and demographic backgrounds. Our findings characterize a set of lived experiences with open data and visualizations in the domain of energy consumption, production, and transmission. This work exposes information receptivity — an individual’s transient state of willingness or openness to receive information — as a blind spot for the data visualization community, complementary to but distinct from previous notions of data visualization literacy and engagement. We observed four clusters of receptivity responses to data-and visualization-based rhetoric: Information-Avoidant, Data-Cautious, Data-Enthusiastic, and Domain-Grounded. Based on our findings, we highlight research opportunities for the visualization community.

"We conducted a longitudinal study during the 2022 U.S. midterm elections, investigating the real-world impacts of uncertainty visualizations. Using our forecast model of the governor elections in 33 states, we created a website and deployed four uncertainty visualizations for the election forecasts: single quantile dotplot (1-Dotplot), dual quantile dotplots (2-Dotplot), dual histogram intervals (2-Interval), and Plinko quantile dotplot (Plinko), an animated design with a physical and probabilistic analogy. Our online experiment ran from Oct. 18, 2022, to Nov. 23, 2022, involving 1,327 participants from 15 states. We use Bayesian multilevel modeling and post-stratification to produce demographically-representative estimates of people’s emotions, trust in forecasts, and political participation intention. We find that election forecast visualizations can heighten emotions, increase trust, and slightly affect people’s intentions to participate in elections. 2-Interval shows the strongest effects across all measures; 1-Dotplot increases trust the most after elections. Both visualizations create emotional and trust gaps between different partisan identities, especially when a Republican candidate is predicted to win. Our qualitative analysis uncovers the complex political and social contexts of election forecast visualizations, showcasing that visualizations may provoke polarization. This intriguing interplay between visualization types, partisanship, and trust exemplifies the fundamental challenge of disentangling visualization from its context, underscoring a need for deeper investigation into the real-world impacts of visualizations.

"Voxel-based segmentation volumes often store a large number of labels and voxels, and the resulting amount of data can make storage, transfer, and interactive visualization difficult. We present a lossless compression technique which addresses these challenges. It processes individual small bricks of a segmentation volume and compactly encodes the labelled regions and their boundaries by an iterative refinement scheme. The result for each brick is a list of labels, and a sequence of operations to reconstruct the brick which is further compressed using rANS-entropy coding. As the relative frequencies of operations are very similar across bricks, the entropy coding can use global frequency tables for an entire data set which enables efficient and effective parallel (de)compression. Our technique achieves high throughput (up to gigabytes per second both for compression and decompression) and strong compression ratios of about 1% to 3% of the original data set size while being applicable to GPU-based rendering. We evaluate our method for various data sets from different fields and demonstrate GPU-based volume visualization with on-the-fly decompression, level-of-detail rendering (with optional on-demand streaming of detail coefficients to the GPU), and a caching strategy for decompressed bricks for further performance improvement.",Fast Compressed Segmentation Volumes for Scientific Visualization,"Segmentation volumes, lossless compression, volume rendering",DTr,2023
"Badminton is a fast-paced sport that requires a strategic combination of spatial, temporal, and technical tactics. To gain a competitive edge at high-level competitions, badminton professionals frequently analyze match videos to gain insights and develop game strategies. However, the current process for analyzing matches is time-consuming and relies heavily on manual note-taking, due to the lack of automatic data collection and appropriate visualization tools. As a result, there is a gap in effectively analyzing matches and communicating insights among badminton coaches and players. This work proposes an end-to-end immersive match analysis pipeline designed in close collaboration with badminton professionals, including Olympic and national coaches and players. We present VIRD, a VR Bird (i.e., shuttle) immersive analysis tool, that supports interactive badminton game analysis in an immersive environment based on 3D reconstructed game views of the match video. We propose a top-down analytic workflow that allows users to seamlessly move from a high-level match overview to a detailed game view of individual rallies and shots, using situated 3D visualizations and video. We collect 3D spatial and dynamic shot data and player poses with computer vision models and visualize them in VR. Through immersive visualizations, coaches can interactively analyze situated spatial data (player positions, poses, and shot trajectories) with flexible viewpoints while navigating between shots and rallies effectively with embodied interaction. We evaluated the usefulness of VIRD with Olympic and national-level coaches and players in real matches. Results show that immersive analytics supports effective badminton match analysis with reduced context-switching costs and enhances spatial understanding with a high sense of presence.",VIRD: Immersive Match Video Analysis for High-Performance Badminton Coaching,"Sports Analytics, Immersive Analytics, Data Visualization",App,2023
"Data visualizations present a massive number of potential messages to an observer. One might notice that one group's average is larger than another's, or that a difference in values is smaller than a difference between two others, or any of a combinatorial explosion of other possibilities. The message that a viewer tends to notice – the message that a visualization ‘affords’ – is strongly affected by how values are arranged in a chart, e.g., how the values are colored or positioned. Although understanding the mapping between a chart’s arrangement and what viewers tend to notice is critical for creating guidelines and recommendation systems, current empirical work is insufficient to lay out clear rules. We present a set of empirical evaluations of how different messages--including ranking, grouping, and part-to-whole relationships--are afforded by variations in ordering, partitioning, spacing, and coloring of values, within the ubiquitous case study of bar graphs. In doing so, we introduce a quantitative method that is easily scalable, reviewable, and replicable, laying groundwork for further investigation of the effects of arrangement on message affordances across other visualizations and tasks.

"Comparative visualization of scalar fields is often facilitated using similarity measures such as edit distances. In this paper, we describe a novel approach for similarity analysis of scalar fields that combines two recently introduced techniques: Wasserstein geodesics/barycenters as well as path mappings, a branch decomposition-independent edit distance. Effectively, we are able to leverage the reduced susceptibility of path mappings to small perturbations in the data when compared with the original Wasserstein distance. Our approach therefore exhibits superior performance and quality in typical tasks such as ensemble summarization, ensemble clustering, and temporal reduction of time series, while retaining practically feasible runtimes. Beyond studying theoretical properties of our approach and discussing implementation aspects, we describe a number of case studies that provide empirical insights into its utility for comparative visualization, and demonstrate the advantages of our method in both synthetic and real-world scenarios. We supply a C++ implementation that can be used to reproduce our results.",Merge Tree Geodesics and Barycenters with Path Mappings,"Topological data analysis, merge trees, scalar data, ensemble data",DTr,2023
"The widespread adoption of Transformers in deep learning, serving as the core framework for numerous large-scale language models, has sparked significant interest in understanding their underlying mechanisms. However, beginners face difficulties in comprehending and learning Transformers due to its complex structure and abstract data representation. We present TransforLearn, the first interactive visual tutorial designed for deep learning beginners and non-experts to comprehensively learn about Transformers. TransforLearn supports interactions for architecture-driven exploration and task-driven exploration, providing insight into different levels of model details and their working processes. It accommodates interactive views of each layer's operation and mathematical formula, helping users to understand the data flow of long text sequences. By altering the current decoder-based recursive prediction results and combining the downstream task abstractions, users can deeply explore model processes. Our user study revealed that the interactions of TransforLearn are positively received.

"Visual clustering is a common perceptual task in scatterplots that supports diverse analytics tasks (e.g., cluster identification). However, even with the same scatterplot, the ways of perceiving clusters (i.e., conducting visual clustering) can differ due to the differences among individuals and ambiguous cluster boundaries. Although such perceptual variability casts doubt on the reliability of data analysis based on visual clustering, we lack a systematic way to efficiently assess this variability. In this research, we study perceptual variability in conducting visual clustering, which we call Cluster Ambiguity. To this end, we introduce CLAMS, a data-driven visual quality measure for automatically predicting cluster ambiguity in monochrome scatterplots. We first conduct a qualitative study to identify key factors that affect the visual separation of clusters (e.g., proximity or size difference between clusters). Based on study findings, we deploy a regression module that estimates the human-judged separability of two clusters. Then, CLAMS predicts cluster ambiguity by analyzing the aggregated results of all pairwise separability between clusters that are generated by the module. CLAMS outperforms widely-used clustering techniques in predicting ground truth cluster ambiguity. Meanwhile, CLAMS exhibits performance on par with human annotators. We conclude our work by presenting two applications for optimizing and benchmarking data mining techniques using CLAMS.

"Over the last decade merge trees have been proven to support a plethora of visualization and analysis tasks since they effectively abstract complex datasets. This paper describes the ExTreeM-Algorithm: a scalable algorithm for the computation of merge trees via extremum graphs. The core idea of ExTreeM is to first derive the extremum graph G of an input scalar field f defined on a cell complex K, and subsequently compute the unaugmented merge tree of f on G instead of K; which are equivalent. Any merge tree algorithm can be carried out significantly faster on G, since K in general contains substantially more cells than G. To further speed up computation, ExTreeM includes a tailored procedure to derive merge trees of extremum graphs. The computation of the fully augmented merge tree, i.e., a merge tree domain segmentation of K, can then be performed in an optional post processing step. All steps of ExTreeM consist of procedures with high parallel efficiency, and we provide a formal proof of its correctness. Our experiments, performed on publicly available datasets, report a speedup of up to one order of magnitude over the state-of-the-art algorithms included in the TTK and VTK-m software libraries, while also requiring significantly less memory and exhibiting superior scaling behavior.",ExTreeM: Scalable Augmented Merge Tree Computation via Extremum Graphs,"Scalar field topology, merge trees, persistence pairs, high performance computing.",DTr,2023
"As the final stage of questionnaire analysis, causal reasoning is the key to turning responses into valuable insights and actionable items for decision-makers. During the questionnaire analysis, classical statistical methods (e.g., Differences-in-Differences) have been widely exploited to evaluate causality between questions. However, due to the huge search space and complex causal structure in data, causal reasoning is still extremely challenging and time-consuming, and often conducted in a trial-and-error manner. On the other hand, existing visual methods of causal reasoning face the challenge of bringing scalability and expert knowledge together and can hardly be used in the questionnaire scenario. In this work, we present a systematic solution to help analysts effectively and efficiently explore questionnaire data and derive causality. Based on the association mining algorithm, we dig question combinations with potential inner causality and help analysts interactively explore the causal sub-graph of each question combination. Furthermore, leveraging the requirements collected from the experts, we built a visualization tool and conducted a comparative study with the state-of-the-art system to show the usability and efficiency of our system.",Causality-Based Visual Analysis of Questionnaire Responses,"Causal analysis, Questionnaire, Design study",A&D,2023

As a ""born scalable"" query technique, AQS starts visualization with a single visual mark representing an aggregation of the entire dataset. The user can then progressively explore the dataset through a sequence of operations abbreviated as P6: pivot (facet an aggregate based on an attribute), partition (lay out a facet in space), peek (see inside a subset using an aggregate visual representation), pile (merge two or more subsets), project (extracting a subset into a new substrate), and prune (discard an aggregate not currently of interest). We validate AQS with Dataopsy, a prototype implementation of AQS that has been designed for fluid interaction on desktop and touch-based mobile devices.

"Ambiguity is pervasive in the complex sensemaking domains of risk assessment and prediction but there remains little research on how to design visual analytics tools to accommodate it. We report on findings from a qualitative study based on a conceptual framework of sensemaking processes to investigate how both new visual analytics designs and existing tools, primarily data tables, support the cognitive work demanded in avalanche forecasting. While both systems yielded similar analytic outcomes we observed differences in ambiguous sensemaking and the analytic actions either afforded. Our findings challenge conventional visualization design guidance in both perceptual and interaction design, highlighting the need for data interfaces that encourage reflection, provoke alternative interpretations, and support the inherently ambiguous nature of sensemaking in this critical application. We review how different visual and interactive forms support or impede analytic processes and introduce ""gisting"" as a significant yet unexplored analytic action for visual analytics research. We conclude with design implications for enabling ambiguity in visual analytics tools to scaffold sensemaking in risk assessment.",Designing for Ambiguity in Visual Analytics: Lessons from Risk Assessment and Prediction,"Complex Systems, Risk Assessment, Sensemaking, Visualization Design",A&D,2023
"In scientific simulations, observations, and experiments, the transfer of data to and from disk and across networks has become a major bottleneck for data analysis and visualization. Compression techniques have been employed to tackle this challenge, but traditional lossy methods often demand conservative error tolerances to meet the numerical accuracy requirements of both anticipated and unknown data analysis tasks. Progressive data compression and retrieval has emerged as a promising solution, where each analysis task dictates its own accuracy needs. However, few analysis algorithms inherently support progressive data processing, and adapting compression techniques, file formats, client/server frameworks, and APIs to support progressivity can be challenging. This paper presents a framework that enables progressive-precision data queries for any data compressor or numerical representation. Our strategy hinges on a multi-component representation that successively reduces the error between the original and compressed field, allowing each field in the progressive sequence to be expressed as a partial sum of components. We have implemented this approach with four established scientific data compressors and assessed its effectiveness using real-world data sets from the SDRBench collection. The results show that our framework competes in accuracy with the standalone compressors it is based upon. Additionally, (de)compression time is proportional to the number of components requested by the user. Finally, our framework allows for fully lossless compression using lossy compressors when a sufficient number of components are employed.",A General Framework for Progressive Data Compression and Retrieval,"Lossy to lossless compression, progressive precision, multi-component expansion, floating-point data",DTr,2023
"In geo-related fields such as urban informatics, atmospheric science, and geography, large-scale spatial time (ST) series (i.e., geo-referred time series) are collected for monitoring and understanding important spatiotemporal phenomena. ST series visualization is an effective means of understanding the data and reviewing spatiotemporal phenomena, which is a prerequisite for in-depth data analysis. However, visualizing these series is challenging due to their large scales, inherent dynamics, and spatiotemporal nature. In this study, we introduce the notion of patterns of evolution in ST series. Each evolution pattern is characterized by 1) a set of ST series that are close in space and 2) a time period when the trends of these ST series are correlated. We then leverage Storyline techniques by considering an analogy between evolution patterns and sessions, and finally design a novel visualization called GeoChron, which is capable of visualizing large-scale ST series in an evolution pattern-aware and narrative-preserving manner. GeoChron includes a mining framework to extract evolution patterns and two-level visualizations to enhance its visual scalability. We evaluate GeoChron with two case studies, an informal user study, an ablation study, parameter analysis, and running time analysis.",Visualizing Large-Scale Spatial Time Series with GeoChron,"Spatiotemporal visualization, spatial time series, Storyline",R&I,2023
"The grammar of graphics is ubiquitous, providing the foundation for a variety of popular visualization tools and toolkits. Yet support for uncertainty visualization in the grammar graphics—beyond simple variations of error bars, uncertainty bands, and density plots—remains rudimentary. Research in uncertainty visualization has developed a rich variety of improved uncertainty visualizations, most of which are difficult to create in existing grammar of graphics implementations. ggdist, an extension to the popular ggplot2 grammar of graphics toolkit, is an attempt to rectify this situation. ggdist unifies a variety of uncertainty visualization types through the lens of distributional visualization, allowing functions of distributions to be mapped to directly to visual channels (aesthetics), making it straightforward to express a variety of (sometimes weird!) uncertainty visualization types. This distributional lens also offers a way to unify Bayesian and frequentist uncertainty visualization by formalizing the latter with the help of confidence distributions. In this paper, I offer a description of this uncertainty visualization paradigm and lessons learned from its development and adoption: ggdist has existed in some form for about six years (originally as part of the tidybayes R package for post-processing Bayesian models), and it has evolved substantially over that time, with several rewrites and API re-organizations as it changed in response to user feedback and expanded to cover increasing varieties of uncertainty visualization types. Ultimately, given the huge expressive power of the grammar of graphics and the popularity of tools built on it, I hope a catalog of my experience with ggdist will provide a catalyst for further improvements to formalizations and implementations of uncertainty visualization in grammar of graphics ecosystems.

"Pictorial visualization seamlessly integrates data and semantic context into visual representation, conveying complex information in an engaging and informative manner. Extensive studies have been devoted to developing authoring tools to simplify the creation of pictorial visualizations. However, mainstream works follow a retrieving-and-editing pipeline that heavily relies on retrieved visual elements from a dedicated corpus, which often compromise data integrity. Text-guided generation methods are emerging, but may have limited applicability due to its predefined entities. In this work, we propose ChartSpark, a novel system that embeds semantic context into chart based on text-to-image generative model. ChartSpark generates pictorial visualizations conditioned on both semantic context conveyed in textual inputs and data information embedded in plain charts. The method is generic for both foreground and background pictorial generation, satisfying the design practices identified from an empirical research into existing pictorial visualizations. We further develop an interactive visual interface that integrates a text analyzer, editing module, and evaluation module to enable users to generate, modify, and assess pictorial visualizations. We experimentally demonstrate the usability of our tool, and conclude with a discussion of the potential of using text-to-image generative model combined with interactive interface for visualization design.",Let the Chart Spark: Embedding Semantic Context into Chart with Generative Model,"pictorial visualization, generative model, authoring tool",R&I,2023
"Existing error-bounded lossy compression techniques control the pointwise error during compression to guarantee the integrity of the decompressed data. However, they typically do not explicitly preserve the topological features in data. When performing post hoc analysis with decompressed data using topological methods, preserving topology in the compression process to obtain topologically consistent and correct scientific insights is desirable. In this paper, we introduce TopoSZ, an error-bounded lossy compression method that preserves the topological features in 2D and 3D scalar fields. Specifically, we aim to preserve the types and locations of local extrema as well as the level set relations among critical points captured by contour trees in the decompressed data. The main idea is to derive topological constraints from contour-tree-induced segmentation from the data domain, and incorporate such constraints with a customized error-controlled quantization strategy from the SZ compressor (version 1.4). Our method allows users to control the pointwise error and the loss of topological features during the compression process with a global error bound and a persistence threshold.",TopoSZ: Preserving Topology in Error-Bounded Lossy Compression,"Lossy compression, contour tree, topology preservation, topological data analysis, topology in visualization",DTr,2023

The results highlight a number of socio-technical challenges the employees faced, including difficulties in training, using and creating dashboards, and transitioning to a modern digital company.

"Dynamically Interactive Visualization (DIVI) is a novel approach for orchestrating interactions within and across static visualizations. DIVI deconstructs Scalable Vector Graphics charts at runtime to infer content and coordinate user input, decoupling interaction from specification logic. This decoupling allows interactions to extend and compose freely across different tools, chart types, and analysis goals. DIVI exploits positional relations of marks to detect chart components such as axes and legends, reconstruct scales and view encodings, and infer data fields. DIVI then enumerates candidate transformations across inferred data to perform linking between views. To support dynamic interaction without prior specification, we introduce a taxonomy that formalizes the space of standard interactions by chart element, interaction type, and input event. We demonstrate DIVI’s usefulness for rapid data exploration and analysis through a usability study with 13 participants and a diverse gallery of dynamically interactive visualizations, including single chart, multi-view, and cross-tool configurations.",DIVI: Dynamically Interactive Visualization,"Interaction, Visualization Tools, Charts, SVG, Exploratory Data Analysis",R&I,2023

"This paper describes a novel method for detecting and visualizing vortex structures in unsteady 2D fluid flows. The method is based on an interactive local reference frame estimation that minimizes the observed time derivative of the input flow field v(x, t). A locally optimal reference frame w(x, t) assists the user in the identification of physically observable vortex structures in Observed Line Integral Convolution (LIC) visualizations. The observed LIC visualizations are interactively computed and displayed in a user-steered vortex lens region, embedded in the context of a conventional LIC visualization outside the lens. The locally optimal reference frame is then used to detect observed critical points, where v = w, which are used to seed vortex core lines. Each vortex core line is computed as a solution of the ordinary differential equation (ODE) (see paper for equation), with an observed critical point as initial condition (w(t0), t0). During integration, we enforce a strict error bound on the difference between the extracted core line and the integration of a path line of the input vector field, i.e., a solution to the ODE (see paper for equation). We experimentally verify that this error depends on the step size of the core line integration. This ensures that our method extracts Lagrangian vortex core lines that are the simultaneous solution of both ODEs with a numerical error that is controllable by the integration step size. We show the usability of our method in the context of an interactive system using a lens metaphor, and evaluate the results in comparison to state-of-the-art vortex core line extraction methods.",Vortex Lens: Interactive Vortex Core Line Extraction using Observed Line Integral Convolution,"Flow visualization, vortex detection, objectivity, observers, reference frames, Lie algebras, visual lens metaphors",S&R,2023
"Data visualizations and narratives are often integrated to convey data stories effectively. Among various data storytelling formats, data videos have been garnering increasing attention. These videos provide an intuitive interpretation of data charts while vividly articulating the underlying data insights. However, the production of data videos demands a diverse set of professional skills and considerable manual labor, including understanding narratives, linking visual elements with narration segments, designing and crafting animations, recording audio narrations, and synchronizing audio with visual animations. To simplify this process, our paper introduces a novel method, referred to as Data Player, capable of automatically generating dynamic data videos with narration-animation interplay. This approach lowers the technical barriers associated with creating data videos rich in narration. To enable narration-animation interplay, Data Player constructs references between visualizations and text input. Specifically, it first extracts data into tables from the visualizations. Subsequently, it utilizes large language models to form semantic connections between text and visuals. Finally, Data Player encodes animation design knowledge as computational low-level constraints, allowing for the recommendation of suitable animation presets that align with the audio narration produced by text-to-speech technologies. We assessed Data Player’s efficacy through an example gallery, a user study, and expert interviews.

"The visualization of streaming high-dimensional data often needs to consider the speed in dimensionality reduction algorithms, the quality of visualized data patterns, and the stability of view graphs that usually change over time with new data. Existing methods of streaming high-dimensional data visualization primarily line up essential modules in a serial manner and often face challenges in satisfying all these design considerations. In this research, we propose a novel parallel framework for streaming high-dimensional data visualization to achieve high data processing speed, high quality in data patterns, and good stability in visual presentations. This framework arranges all essential modules in parallel to mitigate the delays caused by module waiting in serial setups. In addition, to facilitate the parallel pipeline, we redesign these modules with a parametric non-linear embedding method for new data embedding, an incremental learning method for online embedding function updating, and a hybrid strategy for optimized embedding updating. We also improve the coordination mechanism among these modules.

"The circulation of historical books has always been an area of interest for historians. However, the data used to represent the journey of a book across different places and times can be difficult for domain experts to digest due to buried geographical and chronological features within text-based presentations.

"Modern science and industry rely on computational models for simulation, prediction, and data analysis. Spatial blind source separation (SBSS) is a model used to analyze spatial data. Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, it is superior to popular non-spatial methods, like PCA. However, a challenge to its practical use is setting two complex tuning parameters, which requires parameter space analysis. In this paper, we focus on sensitivity analysis (SA). SBSS parameters and outputs are spatial data, which makes SA difficult as few SA approaches in the literature assume such complex data on both sides of the model. Based on the requirements in our design study with statistics experts, we developed a visual analytics prototype for data type agnostic visual sensitivity analysis that fits SBSS and other contexts. The main advantage of our approach is that it requires only dissimilarity measures for parameter settings and outputs. We evaluated the prototype heuristically with visualization experts and through interviews with two SBSS experts. In addition, we show the transferability of our approach by applying it to microclimate simulations. Study participants could confirm suspected and known parameter-output relations, find surprising associations, and identify parameter subspaces to examine in the future.

"Embellishments are features commonly used in everyday visualisations which are demonstrated to enhance assimilation and memorability. Despite their popularity, little is known about their impact on enticing readers to explore visualisations. To address this gap, we conducted 18 interviews with a diverse group of participants who were consumers of news media but non-experts in visualisation and design. Participants were shown ten embellished and plain visualisations collected from the news and asked to rank them based on enticement and ease of understanding. Extending prior work, our interview results suggest that visualisations with multiple embellishment types might make a visualisation perceived as more enticing. An important finding from our study is that the widespread of certain embellishments in the media might have made them part of visualisation conventions, making a visualisation appear more objective but less enticing. Based on these findings, we ran a follow-up online user study showing participants variations of the visualisations with multiple embellishments to isolate each embellishment type and investigate its effect. We found that variations with salient embellishments were perceived as more enticing. We argue that to unpack the concept of embellishments; we must consider two factors: embellishment saliency and editorial styles.

"Constructing supervised machine learning models for real-world video analysis require substantial labeled data, which is costly to acquire due to scarce domain expertise and laborious manual inspection. While data programming shows promise in generating labeled data at scale with user-defined labeling functions, the high dimensional and complex temporal information in videos poses additional challenges for effectively composing and evaluating labeling functions. In this paper, we propose VideoPro, a visual analytics approach to support flexible and scalable video data programming for model steering with reduced human effort. We first extract human-understandable events from videos using computer vision techniques and treat them as atomic components of labeling functions. We further propose a two-stage template mining algorithm that characterizes the sequential patterns of these events to serve as labeling function templates for efficient data labeling. The visual interface of VideoPro facilitates multifaceted exploration, examination, and application of the labeling templates, allowing for effective programming of video data at scale. Moreover, users can monitor the impact of programming on model performance and make informed adjustments during the iterative programming process.

When the simulation is finished, the experts face challenges analyzing its outputs, a large mass of spatiotemporal and multivariate data. From the simulation setup to the analysis of results, working with weather simulations involves several manual and error-prone steps. The complexity of the problem increases exponentially when the experts must deal with ensembles of simulations, a frequent task in their daily duties. To tackle these challenges, we propose ProWis: an interactive and provenance-oriented system to help weather experts build, manage, and analyze simulation ensembles at runtime. Our system follows a human-in-the-loop approach to enable the exploration of multiple atmospheric variables and weather scenarios. ProWis was built in close collaboration with weather experts, and we demonstrate its effectiveness by presenting two case studies of rainfall events in Brazil.","ProWis: A Visual Approach for Building, Managing, and Analyzing Weather Simulation Ensembles at Runtime","Weather visualization, Ensemble visualization, Provenance management, WRF visual setup",App,2023

"We introduce two novel visualization designs to support practitioners in performing identification and discrimination tasks on large value ranges (i.e., several orders of magnitude) in time-series data: (1) The order of magnitude horizon graph, which extends the classic horizon graph; and (2) the order of magnitude line chart, which adapts the log-line chart. These new visualization designs visualize large value ranges by explicitly splitting the mantissa 𝑚 and exponent 𝑒 of a value 𝑣 = 𝑚 · 10𝑒. We evaluate our novel designs against the most relevant state-of-the-art visualizations in an empirical user study. It focuses on four main tasks commonly employed in the analysis of time-series and large value ranges visualization: identification, discrimination, estimation, and trend detection. For each task we analyze error, confidence, and response time. The new order of magnitude horizon graph performs better or equal to all other designs in identification, discrimination, and estimation tasks. Only for trend detection tasks, the more traditional horizon graphs reported better performance. Our results are domain-independent, only requiring time-series data with large value ranges.",Reclaiming the Horizon: Novel Visualization Designs for Time-Series Data with Large Value Ranges,"Visualization techniques, time-series, design study, orders of magnitude, logarithmic scale",R&I,2023
"We present a visual analytics approach for multi-level visual exploration of users’ interaction strategies in an interactive digital environment. The use of interactive touchscreen exhibits in informal learning environments, such as museums and science centers, often incorporate frameworks that classify learning processes, such as Bloom’s taxonomy, to achieve better user engagement and knowledge transfer. To analyze user behavior within these digital environments, interaction logs are recorded to capture diverse exploration strategies. However, analysis of such logs is challenging, especially in terms of coupling interactions and cognitive learning processes, and existing work within learning and educational contexts remains limited. To address these gaps, we develop a visual analytics approach for analyzing interaction logs that supports exploration at the individual user level and multi-user comparison.  The approach utilizes algorithmic methods to identify similarities in users' interactions and reveal their exploration strategies. We motivate and illustrate our approach through an application scenario, using event sequences derived from interaction log data in an experimental study conducted with science center visitors from diverse backgrounds and demographics. The study involves 14 users completing tasks of increasing complexity, designed to stimulate different levels of cognitive learning processes. We implement our approach in an interactive visual analytics prototype system, named VISID, and together with domain experts, discover a set of task-solving exploration strategies, such as ""cascading"" and ""nested-loop"", which reflect different levels of learning processes from Bloom's taxonomy.  Finally, we discuss the generalizability and scalability of the presented system and the need for further research with data acquired in the wild.",Revealing Interaction Dynamics: Multi-Level Visual Exploration of User Strategies with an Interactive Digital Environment,,App,2024
"In soccer, player scouting aims to find players suitable for a team to increase the winning chance in future matches. To scout suitable players, coaches and analysts need to consider various complicated factors, such as the players' performance in the tactics of a new team, which is hard to learn directly from their historical performance. Match simulation methods have been introduced to scout players by estimating their expected contributions to a new team. However, they usually focus on the simulation of match results and hardly support interactive analysis to navigate potential target players and compare them in fine-grained simulated behaviors. In this work, we propose a visual analytics method to assist soccer player scouting based on match simulation. We construct a two-level match simulation framework for estimating both match results and player behaviors when a player comes to a new team. Based on the framework, we develop a visual analytics system, Team-Scouter, to facilitate the simulative-based soccer player scouting process through player navigation, comparison, and explanation. With our system, coaches and analysts can find potential players suitable for the team and compare them on historical and expected performances. To explain the players' expected performances, the system provides a visual comparison between the simulated behaviors of the player and the actual ones. The usefulness and effectiveness of the system are demonstrated by two case studies on a real-world dataset and an expert interview.",Team-Scouter: Simulative Visual Analytics of Soccer Player Scouting,,App,2024
"Dynamic topic modeling is useful at discovering the development and change in latent topics over time. However, present methodology relies on algorithms that separate document and word representations. This prevents the creation of a meaningful embedding space where changes in word usage and documents can be directly analyzed in a temporal context. This paper proposes an expansion of the compass-aligned temporal Word2Vec methodology into dynamic topic modeling. Such a method allows for the direct comparison of word and document embeddings across time in dynamic topics. This enables the creation of visualizations that incorporate diachronic word embeddings within the context of documents into topic visualizations. In experiments against the current state-of-the-art, our proposed method demonstrates overall competitive performance in topic relevancy and diversity across temporal datasets of varying size. Simultaneously, it provides insightful visualizations focused on temporal word embeddings while maintaining the insights provided by global topic evolution, advancing our understanding of how topics evolve over time.",Visualizing Temporal Topic Embeddings with a Compass,,A&D,2024
"Propagation analysis refers to studying how information spreads on social media, a pivotal endeavor for understanding social sentiment and public opinions. Numerous studies contribute to visualizing information spread, but few have considered the implicit and complex diffusion patterns among multiple platforms. To bridge the gap, we collaborated with professionals to discover crucial factors that dissect the mechanism of cross-platform information spread. Based on that, we propose an information diffusion model that estimates the likelihood of a topic/post spreading among different social media platforms. Moreover, we propose a novel visual metaphor that encapsulates cross-platform patterns in a manner analogous to the spread of seeds across gardens. Specifically, we visualize social platforms, posts, implicit cross-platform routes, and salient instances as elements of a virtual ecosystem — gardens, flowers, winds, and seeds, respectively. We further develop a visual analytic system, namely BloomWind, that enables users to quickly identify the cross-platform diffusion patterns and investigate the relevant social media posts. Ultimately, we demonstrate the usage of BloomWind through two case studies and validate its effectiveness using expert interviews.",Blowing Seeds Across Gardens: Visualizing Implicit Propagation of Cross-Platform Social Media Posts,,App,2024
"When treating Head and Neck cancer patients, oncologists have to navigate a complicated series of treatment decisions for each patient. The relationship between each treatment decision and the potential tradeoff of tumor control and toxicity risk is poorly understood, leaving oncologists to largely rely on institutional knowledge and general guidelines that do not take into account specific patient circumstances. Evaluating these risks relies on a complicated understanding of several different factors such as patient health, spatial tumor spread and treatment side effect risk that can not be captured through simple heuristics. To support clinicians in better understanding tradeoffs when deciding on treatment courses, we developed DITTO, a digital-twin and visual computing system that allows clinicians to analyze nuanced patient risk for each patient and decide on an optimal treatment plan. DITTO relies on a sequential Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) system to deliver personalized risk of both long-term and short-term disease outcome and toxicity risk for HNC patients. Based on a participatory collaborative design alongside oncologists, we also implement several explainability methods to support clinical trust and encourage healthy skepticism when using our models. We evaluate the efficacy of our model through quantitative evaluation of model performance and case studies with qualitative feedback. Finally, we discuss design lessons for developing clinical visual XAI applications for clinical end users.",DITTO: A Visual Digital Twin for Interventions and Temporal Treatment Outcomes in Head and Neck Cancer,,App,2024
"There is increased interest in understanding the interplay between text and visuals in the field of data visualization. However, this attention has predominantly been on the use of text in standalone visualizations (such as text annotation overlays) or augmenting text stories supported by a series of independent views. In this paper, we shift from the traditional focus on single-chart annotations to characterize the nuanced but crucial communication role of text in the complex environment of interactive dashboards. Through a survey and analysis of 190 dashboards in the wild, plus 13 expert interview sessions with experienced dashboard authors, we highlight the distinctive nature of text as an integral component of the dashboard experience, while delving into the categories, semantic levels, and functional roles of text, and exploring how these text elements are coalesced by dashboard authors to guide and inform dashboard users. Our contributions are threefold. First, we distill qualitative and quantitative findings from our studies to characterize current practices of text use in dashboards, including a categorization of text-based components and design patterns. Second, we leverage current practices and existing literature to propose, discuss, and validate recommended practices for text in dashboards, embodied as a set of 12 heuristics that underscore the semantic and functional role of text in offering navigational cues, contextualizing data insights, supporting reading order, among other concerns. Third, we reflect on our findings plus existing literature to identify gaps and propose opportunities for data visualization researchers to push the boundaries on text usage for dashboards, from authoring support and interactivity to text generation and content personalization. Our research underscores the significance of elevating text as a first-class citizen in data visualization, and the need to support the inclusion of textual components and their interactive affordances in dashboard design.",From Instruction to Insight: Exploring the Semantic and Functional Roles of Text in Interactive Dashboards,,T&E,2024
"While previous work has found success in deploying visualizations as museum exhibits, it has not investigated whether museum context impacts visitor behaviour with these exhibits. We present an interactive Deep-time Literacy Visualization Exhibit (DeLVE) to help museum visitors understand deep time (lengths of extremely long geological processes) by improving proportional reasoning skills through comparison of different time periods. DeLVE uses a new visualization idiom, Connected Multi-Tier Ranges, to visualize curated datasets of past events across multiple scales of time, relating extreme scales with concrete scales that have more familiar magnitudes and units. Museum staff at three separate museums approved the deployment of DeLVE as a digital kiosk, and devoted time to curating a unique dataset in each of them. We collect data from two sources, an observational study and system trace logs. We discuss the importance of context: similar museum exhibits in different contexts were received very differently by visitors. We additionally discuss differences in our process from Sedlmair et al.'s design study methodology which is focused on design studies triggered by connection with collaborators rather than the discovery of a concept to communicate.

"Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT and Llama, have revolutionized various domains through their impressive natural language processing capabilities. However, their deployment raises significant ethical and security concerns, including their potential misuse for generating fake news or aiding illegal activities. Thus, ensuring the development of secure and trustworthy LLMs is crucial. Traditional red teaming approaches for identifying vulnerabilities in AI models are limited by their reliance on manual prompt construction and expertise. This paper introduces a novel visual analytics system, AdversaFlow, designed to enhance the security of LLMs against adversarial attacks through human-AI collaboration. Our system, which involves adversarial training between a target model and a red model, is equipped with a unique multi-level adversarial flow visualization and a fluctuation path visualization technique. These features provide a detailed insight into the adversarial dynamics and the robustness of LLMs, thereby enabling AI security experts to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities effectively. We deliver quantitative evaluations for the models and present case studies that validate the utility of our system and share insights for future AI security solutions. Our contributions include a human-AI collaboration framework for LLM red teaming, a comprehensive visual analytics system to support adversarial pattern presentation and fluctuation analysis, and valuable lessons learned in visual analytics for AI security.",AdversaFlow: Visual Red Teaming for Large Language Models with Multi-Level Adversarial Flow,,App,2024
"A growing body of work draws on feminist thinking to challenge assumptions about how people engage with and use visualizations. This work draws on feminist values, driving design and research guidelines that account for the influences of power and neglect. This prior work is largely prescriptive, however, forgoing articulation of how feminist theories of knowledge — or feminist epistemology — can alter research design and outcomes. At the core of our work is an engagement with feminist epistemology, drawing attention to how a new framework for how we know what we know enabled us to overcome intellectual tensions in our research. Specifically, we focus on the theoretical concept of entanglement, central to recent feminist scholarship, and contribute: a history of entanglement in the broader scope of feminist theory; an articulation of the main points of entanglement theory for a visualization context; and a case study of research outcomes as evidence of the potential of feminist epistemology to impact visualization research. This work answers a call in the community to embrace a broader set of theoretical and epistemic foundations and provides a starting point for bringing different theories into visualization research.",Entanglements for Visualization: Changing Research Outcomes through Feminist Theory,,T&E,2024
"Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in intelligent visualization systems, especially for domain-specific applications. Integrating LLMs into visualization systems presents challenges, and we categorize these challenges into three alignments: domain problems with LLMs, visualization with LLMs, and interaction with LLMs. To achieve these alignments, we propose a framework and outline a workflow to guide the application of fine-tuned LLMs to enhance visual interactions for domain-specific tasks. These alignment challenges are critical in education as they call for an intelligent visualization system to support beginners' self-regulated learning. Therefore, we apply the framework to education and introduce Tailor-Mind, an interactive visualization system designed to facilitate self-regulated learning for artificial intelligence beginners. Drawing on insights from a preliminary study, we identify self-regulated learning tasks and fine-tuning objectives to guide visualization design and tuning data construction. Our focus on aligning visualization with fine-tuned LLM makes Tailor-Mind more like a personalized tutor. Tailor-Mind also supports interactive recommendations to help beginners better achieve their learning goals. Model performance evaluations and user studies confirm that Tailor-Mind improves the self-regulated learning experience, effectively validating the proposed framework.",Fine-Tuned Large Language Model for Visualization System: A Study on Self-Regulated Learning in Education,,App,2024
"Tactics play an important role in team sports by guiding how players interact on the field. Both sports fans and experts have a demand for analyzing sports tactics. Existing approaches allow users to visually perceive the multivariate tactical effects. However, these approaches usually consider each tactic as a whole, making it difficult for users to connect the complex interactions inside each tactic to the final tactical effect. In this work, we collaborate with basketball experts and propose a progressive approach to help users gain a deeper understanding of how each tactic works and customize tactics on demand. Users can progressively sketch on a tactic board, and a coach agent will simulate the possible actions in each step and present the simulation to users with facet visualizations. We develop an extensible framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) and visualizations to help users communicate with the coach agent with multimodal inputs. Based on the framework, we design and develop Smartboard, an agent-based interactive visualization system for fine-grained tactical analysis. Smartboard provides users with a structured process of setup, simulation, and evolution, allowing for iterative exploration of tactics based on specific personalized scenarios. We conduct case studies based on real-world basketball datasets to demonstrate the usefulness of our system.",Smartboard: Visual Exploration of Team Tactics with LLM Agent,,A&D,2024
"“Correlation does not imply causation” is a famous mantra in statistical and visual analysis. However, consumers of visualizations often draw causal conclusions when only correlations between variables are shown. In this paper, we investigate factors that contribute to causal relationships users perceive in visualizations. We collected a corpus of concept pairs from variables in widely used datasets and created visualizations that depict varying correlative associations using three typical statistical chart types. We conducted two MTurk studies on (1) preconceived notions on causal relations without charts, and (2) perceived causal relations with charts, for each concept pair. Our results indicate that people make assumptions about causal relationships between pairs of concepts even without seeing any visualized data. Moreover, our results suggest that these assumptions constitute causal priors that, in combination with chart type and visualized association, impact how data visualizations are interpreted. The results also suggest that causal priors may lead to over- or under-estimation in perceived causal relations in different circumstances, and that those priors can also impact users’ confidence in their causal assessments. Using data from the studies, we develop a model to capture the interaction between causal priors and visualized associations as they combine to impact a user’s perceived causal relations. In addition to reporting the study results and analyses, we provide an open dataset of causal priors for 56 specific concept pairs that can serve as a potential benchmark for future studies. We also suggest heuristic-based guidelines to help designers improve visualization design choices to better support visual causal inference.",Causal Priors and Their Influence on Judgements of Causality in Visualized Data,,T&E,2024
"Acute stroke demands prompt diagnosis and treatment to achieve optimal patient outcomes. However, the intricate and irregular nature of clinical data associated with acute stroke, particularly blood pressure (BP) measurements, presents substantial obstacles to effective visual analytics and decision-making. Through a year-long collaboration with experienced neurologists, we developed PhenoFlow, a visual analytics system that leverages the collaboration between human and Large Language Models (LLMs) to analyze the extensive and complex data of acute ischemic stroke patients. PhenoFlow pioneers an innovative workflow, where the LLM serves as a data wrangler while neurologists explore and supervise the output using visualizations and natural language interactions. This approach enables neurologists to focus more on decision-making with reduced cognitive load. To protect sensitive patient information, PhenoFlow only utilizes metadata to make inferences and synthesize executable codes, without accessing raw patient data. This ensures that the results are both reproducible and interpretable while maintaining patient privacy. The system incorporates a slice-and-wrap design that employs temporal folding to create an overlaid circular visualization. Combined with a linear bar graph, this design aids in exploring meaningful patterns within irregularly measured BP data. Through case studies, PhenoFlow has demonstrated its capability to support iterative analysis of extensive clinical datasets, reducing cognitive load and enabling neurologists to make well-informed decisions. Grounded in long-term collaboration with domain experts, our research demonstrates the potential of utilizing LLMs to tackle current challenges in data-driven clinical decision-making for acute ischemic stroke patients.",PhenoFlow: A Human-LLM Driven Visual Analytics System for Exploring Large and Complex Stroke Datasets,,App,2024
"Citations allow quickly identifying related research. If multiple publications are selected as seeds, specific suggestions for related literature can be made based on the number of incoming and outgoing citation links to this selection. Interactively adding recommended publications to the selection refines the next suggestion and incrementally builds a relevant collection of publications. Following this approach, the paper presents a search and foraging approach, PUREsuggest, which combines citation-based suggestions with augmented visualizations of the citation network. The focus and novelty of the approach is, first, the transparency of how the rankings are explained visually and, second, that the process can be steered through user-defined keywords, which reflect topics of interests. The system can be used to build new literature collections, to update and assess existing ones, as well as to use the collected literature for identifying relevant experts in the field.

"Inspired by recent advances in digital fabrication, artists and scientists have demonstrated that physical data encodings (i.e., data physicalizations) can increase engagement with data, foster collaboration, and in some cases, improve data legibility and analysis relative to digital alternatives. However, prior empirical studies have only investigated abstract data encoded in physical form (e.g., laser cut bar charts) and not continuously sampled spatial data fields relevant to climate and medical science (e.g., heights, temperatures, densities, and velocities sampled on a spatial grid). This paper presents the design and results of the first study to characterize human performance in 3D spatial data analysis tasks across analogous physical and digital visualizations. Participants analyzed continuous spatial elevation data with three visualization modalities: (1) 2D digital visualization; (2) perspective-tracked, stereoscopic ""fishtank"" virtual reality; and (3) 3D printed data physicalization. Their tasks included tracing paths downhill, looking up spatial locations and comparing their relative heights, and identifying and reporting the minimum and maximum heights within certain spatial regions. As hypothesized, in most cases, participants performed the tasks just as well or better in the physical modality (based on time and error metrics). Additional results include an analysis of open-ended feedback from participants and discussion of implications for further research on the value of data physicalization.

"Written language is a useful mode for non-visual creative activities like writing essays and planning searches. This paper investigates the integration of written language into the visualization design process. We call this idea a `written rudder,' , since it acts as a guiding force or strategy for the design. Via an interview study of 24 working visualization designers, we first established that only a minority of participants systematically use written rudders to aid in design. A second study with 15 visualization designers examined four different variants of rudders: asking questions, stating conclusions, composing a narrative, and writing titles. Overall, participants had a positive reaction; designers recognized the benefits of explicitly writing down components of the design and indicated that they would use this approach in future design work.  More specifically, two approaches –- writing questions and writing conclusions/takeaways –- were seen as beneficial across the design process, while writing narratives showed promise mainly for the creation stage. Although concerns around potential bias during data exploration were raised, participants also discussed strategies to mitigate such concerns. This paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between language and visualization, and proposes a straightforward, lightweight addition to the visualization design process.",It's a Good Idea to Put It Into Words: Writing 'Rudders' in the Initial Stages of Visualization Design,,T&E,2024
"To deploy machine learning (ML) models on-device, practitioners use compression algorithms to shrink and speed up models while maintaining their high-quality output. A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison, including tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in model behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To support real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual system called Compress & Compare. Within a single interface, Compress & Compare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced behavior changes by comparing models' predictions, weights, and activations. We demonstrate how Compress & Compare supports common compression analysis tasks through two case studies—debugging failed compression on generative language models and identifying compression-induced biases in image classification. We further evaluate Compress & Compare in a user study with eight compression experts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression workflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage thorough analysis of compression’s effect on model behavior. Through these evaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual analytics tools should consider and Compress & Compare visualizations that may generalize to broader model comparison tasks.",Compress and Compare: Interactively Evaluating Efficiency and Behavior Across ML Model Compression Experiments,,A&D,2024
"Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 which support multimodal input (i.e., prompts containing images in addition to text) have immense potential to advance visualization research. However, many questions exist about the visual capabilities of such models, including how well they can read and interpret visually represented data. In our work, we address this question by evaluating the GPT-4 multimodal LLM using a suite of task sets meant to assess the model’s visualization literacy. The task sets are based on existing work in the visualization community addressing both automated chart question answering and human visualization literacy across multiple settings. Our assessment finds that GPT-4 can perform tasks such as recognizing trends and extreme values, and also demonstrates some understanding of visualization design best-practices. By contrast, GPT-4 struggles with simple value retrieval when not provided with the original dataset, lacks the ability to reliably distinguish between colors in charts, and occasionally suffers from hallucination and inconsistency. We conclude by reflecting on the model’s strengths and weaknesses as well as the potential utility of models like GPT-4 for future visualization research.

"Composite visualization represents a widely embraced design that combines multiple visual representations to create an integrated view.  However, the traditional approach of creating composite visualizations in immersive environments typically occurs asynchronously outside of the immersive space and is carried out by experienced experts.  In this work, we take the first step to empower users to participate in the creation of composite visualization within immersive environments through embodied interactions.  This could provide a flexible and fluid experience for data exploration and facilitate a deep understanding of the relationship between data visualizations. We begin with forming a design space of embodied interactions to create various types of composite visualizations with the consideration of data relationships. Drawing inspiration from people's natural experience of manipulating physical objects, we design interactions to directly assemble composite visualizations in immersive environments. Building upon the design space, we present a series of case studies showcasing the interactive method to create different kinds of composite visualizations in Virtual Reality (VR). Subsequently, we conduct a user study to evaluate the usability of the derived interaction techniques and user experience of embodiedly creating composite visualizations.  We find that empowering users to participate in composite visualizations through embodied interactions enables them to flexibly leverage different visualization representations for understanding and communicating the relationships between different views, which underscores the potential for a set of application scenarios in the future.",CompositingVis: Exploring Interaction for Creating Composite Visualizations in Immersive Environments,,R&I,2024
"Points of interest on a map such as restaurants, hotels, or subway stations, give rise to categorical point data: data that have a fixed location and one or more categorical attributes. Consequently, recent years have seen various set visualization approaches that visually connect points of the same category to support users in understanding the spatial distribution of categories. Existing methods use complex and often highly irregular shapes to connect points of the same category, leading to high cognitive load for the user. In this paper we introduce SimpleSets that use simple shapes to enclose categorical point patterns and provide a low-complexity overview of the data distribution. We give formal definitions of point patterns that correspond to simple shapes and describe an algorithm that partitions categorical points into few such patterns. Our second contribution is a rendering algorithm that transforms a given partition into a clean set of shapes resulting in an aesthetically pleasing set visualization. Our algorithm pays particular attention to resolving intersections between nearby shapes in a consistent manner. We compare SimpleSets to the state-of-the-art set visualizations using standard datasets from the literature. SimpleSets are designed to visualize disjoint categories, however, we discuss avenues to extend our technique to overlapping set systems.",SimpleSets: Capturing Categorical Point Patterns with Simple Shapes,,S&R,2024
"Interactive visualizations are powerful tools for Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), but how do they affect the observations analysts make about their data? We conducted a qualitative experiment with 13 professional data scientists analyzing two datasets within Jupyter notebooks, collecting a rich dataset of interaction traces and think-aloud utterances. By qualitatively analyzing participant verbalizations, we introduce the concept of ""observation-analysis states."" These states capture both the dataset characteristics a participant focuses on and the insights they express. Our definition reveals that interactive visualizations on average lead to earlier and more complex insights about relationships between dataset attributes compared to static visualizations. Moreover, this process identified new measures for studying representation use in notebooks such as hover time, revisiting rate and representational diversity. In particular, revisiting rates revealed behavior where analysts revisit particular representations throughout the time course of an analysis, serving more as navigational aids through an EDA than as strict hypothesis answering tools. We show how these measures helped identify other patterns of analysis behavior, such as the ""80-20 rule"", where a small subset of representations drove the majority of observations. Based on these findings, we offer design guidelines for interactive exploratory analysis tooling and reflect on future directions for studying the role that visualizations play in EDA.",Charting EDA: How Visualizations and Interactions Shape Analysis in Computational Notebooks.,,T&E,2024
"Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have emerged as powerful tools for solving complex optimization problems characterized by multiple, often conflicting, objectives. While advancements have been made in computational efficiency as well as diversity and convergence of solutions, a critical challenge persists: the internal evolutionary mechanisms are opaque to human users. Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex algorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying evolutionary operators and population dynamics in MOEAs aligns well with a visual analytics paradigm. This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual analytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of population dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs. Informed by preliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes a multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration ranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting fine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations. In contrast to conventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each generation, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and dynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert interviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems.",ParetoTracker: Understanding Population Dynamics in Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms through Visual Analytics,,App,2024
"This paper presents an interactive technique to explain visual patterns in network visualizations to analysts who are unfamiliar with these visualizations and who are learning to read them. Learning a visualization requires mastering its visual grammar and decoding information presented through visual marks, graphical encodings, and spatial configurations. To help people learn unfamiliar network visualization designs and extract meaningful information, we introduce the concept of interactive pattern explanation that allows viewers to select an arbitrary area in a visualization, then mines the underlying data patterns, and eventually explains both visual and data patterns present in the viewer’s selection. In a qualitative and a quantitative user study with a total of 32 participants, we compare interactive pattern explanations to only textual and only visual (cheatsheets) explanations. Our results show that interactive explanations increase learning of i) unfamiliar visualizations, ii) patterns in network science, and iii) the respective network terminology.",Does This Have a Particular Meaning?: Interactive Pattern Explanation for Network Visualizations,,R&I,2024
"Emerging multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit great potential for chart question answering (CQA). Recent efforts primarily focus on scaling up training datasets (\ie, charts, data tables, and question-answer (QA) pairs) through data collection and synthesis. However, our empirical study on existing MLLMs and CQA datasets reveals notable gaps. First, current data collection and synthesis focus on data volume and lack consideration of fine-grained visual encodings and QA tasks, resulting in unbalanced data distribution divergent from practical CQA scenarios. Second, existing work follows the training recipe of the base MLLMs initially designed for natural images, under-exploring the adaptation to unique chart characteristics, such as rich text elements. To fill the gap, we propose a visualization-referenced instruction tuning approach to guide the training dataset enhancement and model development. Specifically, we propose a novel data engine to effectively filter diverse and high-quality data from existing datasets and subsequently refine and augment the data using LLM-based generation techniques to better align with practical QA tasks and visual encodings. Then, to facilitate the adaptation to chart characteristics, we utilize the enriched data to train an MLLM by unfreezing the vision encoder and incorporating a mixture-of-resolution adaptation strategy for enhanced fine-grained recognition. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach. Even with fewer training examples, our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art CQA models on established benchmarks. We also contribute a dataset split as a benchmark for future research.",Advancing Multimodal Large Language Models in Chart Question Answering with Visualization-Referenced Instruction Tuning,,R&I,2024
"The Dunning-Kruger Effect (DKE) is a metacognitive phenomenon where low-skilled individuals tend to overestimate their competence while high-skilled individuals tend to underestimate their competence. This effect has been observed in a number of domains including humor, grammar, and logic. In this paper, we explore if and how DKE manifests in visual reasoning and visual data analysis tasks.  Across two online user studies involving (1) a sliding puzzle game and (2) a scatterplot-based categorization task, we demonstrate that individuals are susceptible to DKE in visual tasks: those who performed best underestimated their performance, while bottom performers overestimated their performance. In addition, we contribute novel analyses that correlate susceptibility of DKE with several variables including personality traits and user interactions.  Our findings pave the way for novel modes of bias detection via interaction patterns and establish promising directions towards interventions tailored to an individual's personality traits.",Unmasking Dunning-Kruger Effect in Visual Reasoning and Visual Data Analysis,,T&E,2024
"We present ProvenanceWidgets, a Javascript library of UI control elements such as radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns to track and dynamically overlay a user's analytic provenance.

In this paper, we discuss how we design modular UI control elements to track how often and how recently a user interacts with them and design visual overlays showing an aggregated summary as well as a detailed temporal history. We demonstrate the capability of ProvenanceWidgets by recreating three prior widget libraries: (1) Scented Widgets, (2) Phosphor objects, and (3) Dynamic Query Widgets. We also evaluated its expressiveness and conducted case studies with visualization developers to evaluate its effectiveness.

Force-directed graph layout algorithms promote the visual saliency of clusters, as they generally bring adjacent nodes closer together, and push non-adjacent nodes apart. In this work, we study the impact of node ordering on the visual saliency of clusters in orderable node-link diagrams, namely radial diagrams, arc diagrams and symmetric arc diagrams. Through a crowdsourced controlled experiment, we show that users can count clusters consistently more accurately, and to a large extent faster, with orderable node-link diagrams than with three state-of-the art force-directed layout algorithms, i.e., `Linlog', `Backbone' and, `sfdp'. The measured advantage is greater in case of low cluster separability and/or low compactness.

"Placing text labels is a common way to explain key elements in a given scene. Given a graphic input and original label information, how to place labels to meet both geometric and aesthetic requirements is an open challenging problem. Geometry-wise, traditional rule-driven solutions struggle to capture the complex interactions between labels, let alone consider graphical/appearance content. In terms of aesthetics, training/evaluation data ideally require nontrivial effort and expertise in design, thus resulting in a lack of decent datasets for learning-based methods. To address the above challenges, we formulate the task with a graph representation, where nodes correspond to labels and edges to the between-label interactions, and treat label placement as a node position prediction problem. With this novel representation, we design a Label Placement Graph Transformer (LPGT) to predict label positions. Specifically, edge-level attention, conditioned on node representations, is introduced to reveal potential relationships between labels. To integrate graphic/image information, we design a feature aligning strategy that extracts deep features for nodes and edges efficiently. Next, to address the dataset issue, we collect commercial illustrations with professionally designed label layouts from household appliance manuals, and annotate them with useful information to create a novel dataset named the Appliance Manual Illustration Labels (AMIL) dataset. In the thorough evaluation on AMIL, our LPGT solution achieves promising label placement performance compared with popular baselines.",Graph Transformer for Label Placement,,App,2024
"How do cancer cells grow, divide, proliferate and die? How do drugs influence these processes? These are difficult questions that we can attempt to answer with a combination of time-series microscopy experiments, classification algorithms, and data visualization.  However, collecting this type of data and applying algorithms to segment and track cells and construct lineages of proliferation is error-prone; and identifying the errors can be challenging since it often requires cross-checking multiple data types. Similarly, analyzing and communicating the results necessitates synthesizing different data types into a single narrative. State-of-the-art visualization methods for such data use independent line charts, tree diagrams, and images in separate views. However, this spatial separation requires the viewer of these charts to combine the relevant pieces of data in memory. To simplify this challenging task, we describe design principles for weaving cell images, time-series data, and tree data into a cohesive visualization. Our design principles are based on choosing a primary data type that drives the layout and integrates the other data types into that layout. We then introduce Aardvark, a system that uses these principles to implement novel visualization techniques. Based on Aardvark, we demonstrate the utility of each of these approaches for discovery, communication, and data debugging in a series of case studies.","Aardvark: Composite Visualizations of Trees, Time-Series, and Images",,R&I,2024
"Exploratory data science is an iterative process of obtaining, cleaning, profiling, analyzing, and interpreting data. This cyclical way of working creates challenges within the linear structure of computational notebooks that lead to issues with code quality, recall, and reproducibility. To remedy this, we present Loops, a set of visual support techniques for iterative and exploratory data analysis in computational notebooks. Loops leverages provenance information to visualize the impact of changes made within a notebook. In visualizations of the notebook history, we trace the evolution of the notebook over time and highlight differences between versions. Loops visualizes the provenance of code, markdown, tables, visualizations, and images and their respective differences. Analysts can explore these differences in detail in a separate view. Loops not only improves the reproducibility of notebooks, but also supports analysts in their data science work by showing the effects of changes and facilitating comparison of multiple versions. We demonstrate utility and potential impact of our approach in two use cases and feedback from notebook users from a range of backgrounds.",Loops: Leveraging Provenance and Visualization to Support Exploratory Data Analysis in Notebooks,,App,2024
"People commonly utilize visualizations not only to examine a given dataset, but also to draw generalizable conclusions about the underlying models or phenomena. Previous research has compared human visual inference to that of an optimal Bayesian agent, with deviations from rational analysis viewed as problematic. However, human reliance on non-normative heuristics may prove advantageous in certain circumstances. We investigate scenarios where human intuition might surpass idealized statistical rationality. In two experiments, we examine individuals' accuracy in characterizing the parameters of known data-generating models from bivariate visualizations. Our findings indicate that, although participants generally exhibited lower accuracy compared to statistical models, they frequently outperformed Bayesian agents, particularly when faced with extreme samples. Participants appeared to rely on their internal models to filter out noisy visualizations, thus improving their resilience against spurious data. However, participants displayed overconfidence and struggled with uncertainty estimation. They also exhibited higher variance than statistical machines. Our findings suggest that analyst gut reactions to visualizations may provide an advantage, even when departing from rationality. These results carry implications for designing visual analytics tools, offering new perspectives on how to integrate statistical models and analyst intuition for improved inference and decision-making.",Trust Your Gut: Comparing Human and Machine Inference from Noisy Visualizations,,T&E,2024
"Providing effective guidance for users has long been an important and challenging task for efficient exploratory visual analytics, especially when selecting variables for visualization in high-dimensional datasets. Correlation is the most widely applied metric for guidance in statistical and analytical tools, however a reliance on correlation may lead users towards false positives when interpreting causal relations in the data. In this work, inspired by prior insights on the benefits of counterfactual visualization in supporting visual causal inference, we propose a novel, simple, and efficient counterfactual guidance method to enhance causal inference performance in guided exploratory analytics based on insights and concerns gathered from expert interviews. Our technique aims to capitalize on the benefits of counterfactual approaches while reducing their complexity for users. We integrated counterfactual guidance into an exploratory visual analytics system, and using a synthetically generated ground-truth causal dataset, conducted a comparative user study and evaluated to what extent counterfactual guidance can help lead users to more precise visual causal inferences. The results suggest that counterfactual guidance improved visual causal inference performance, and also led to different exploratory behaviors compared to correlation-based guidance. Based on these findings, we offer future directions to incorporate and examine counterfactual guidance to better support exploratory visual analytics.",Beyond Correlation: Incorporating Counterfactual Guidance to Better Support Exploratory Visual Analysis,,A&D,2024
"In various scientific and industrial domains, analyzing multivariate spatial data, i.e., vectors associated with spatial locations, is common practice. To analyze those datasets, analysts may turn to models such as Spatial Blind Source Separation (SBSS). Designed explicitly for spatial data analysis, SBSS finds latent components in the dataset and is superior to popular non-spatial models, like PCA. However, when analysts try different tuning parameter settings, the amount of latent components complicates analytical tasks. Based on our years-long collaboration with SBSS researchers, we propose a visualization approach to tackle this challenge. The main component is UnDRground Tubes (UT), a general-purpose idiom combining ideas from set visualization and multidimensional projections. We describe the UT visualization pipeline and integrate UT into an interactive multiple-view system. We demonstrate its effectiveness through interviews with SBSS experts, a qualitative evaluation with visualization experts, and computational experiments. SBSS experts were excited about our approach. They saw many benefits for their work and potential applications for geostatistical data analysis more generally. UT was also very well received by visualization experts. Our benchmarks show that UT projections and its heuristics are appropriate.",UnDRground Tubes: Exploring Spatial Data With Multidimensional Projections and Set Visualization,,App,2024
"We developed and validated an instrument to measure the perceived readability in data visualization: PREVis. Researchers and practitioners can easily use this instrument as part of their evaluations to compare the perceived readability of different visual data representations. Our instrument can complement results from controlled experiments on user task performance or provide additional data during in-depth qualitative work such as design iterations when developing a new technique. Although readability is recognized as an essential quality of data visualizations, so far there has not been a unified definition of the construct in the context of visual representations. As a result, researchers often lack guidance for determining how to ask people to rate their perceived readability of a visualization. To address this issue, we engaged in a rigorous process to develop the first validated instrument targeted at the subjective readability of visual data representations. Our final instrument consists of 11 items across 4 dimensions: understandability, layout clarity, readability of data values, and readability of data patterns. We provide the questionnaire as a document with implementation guidelines on osf.io/9cg8j. Beyond this instrument, we contribute a discussion of how researchers have previously assessed visualization readability, and an analysis of the factors underlying perceived readability in visual data representations.",PREVis: Perceived Readability Evaluation for Visualizations,,T&E,2024
"This paper presents a novel end-to-end framework for closed-form computation and visualization of critical point uncertainty in 2D uncertain scalar fields. Critical points are fundamental topological descriptors used in the visualization and analysis of scalar fields. The uncertainty inherent in data (e.g., observational and experimental data, approximations in simulations, and compression), however, creates uncertainty regarding critical point positions. Uncertainty in critical point positions, therefore, cannot be ignored, given their impact on downstream data analysis tasks. In this work, we study uncertainty in critical points as a function of uncertainty in data modeled with probability distributions. Although Monte Carlo (MC) sampling techniques have been used in prior studies to quantify critical point uncertainty, they are often expensive and are infrequently used in production-quality visualization software. We, therefore, propose a new end-to-end framework to address these challenges that comprises a threefold contribution. First, we derive the critical point uncertainty in closed form, which is more accurate and efficient than the conventional MC sampling methods. Specifically, we provide the closed-form and semianalytical (a mix of closed-form and MC methods) solutions for parametric (e.g., uniform, Epanechnikov) and nonparametric models (e.g., histograms) with finite support. Second, we accelerate critical point probability computations using a parallel implementation with the VTK-m library, which is platform portable. Finally, we demonstrate the integration of our implementation with the ParaView software system to demonstrate near-real-time results for real datasets.",Uncertainty Visualization of Critical Points of 2D Scalar Fields for Parametric and Nonparametric Probabilistic Models,,T&E,2024
"Participatory budgeting (PB) is a democratic approach to allocating municipal spending that has been adopted in many places in recent years, including in Chicago. Current PB voting resembles a ballot where residents are asked which municipal projects, such as school improvements and road repairs, to fund with a limited budget. In this work, we ask how interactive visualization can benefit PB by conducting a design probe-based interview study (N=13) with policy workers and academics with expertise in PB, urban planning, and civic HCI. Our probe explores how graphical elicitation of voter preferences and a dashboard of voting statistics can be incorporated into a realistic PB tool. Through qualitative analysis, we find that visualization creates opportunities for city government to set expectations about budget constraints while also granting their constituents greater freedom to articulate a wider range of preferences. However, using visualization to provide transparency about PB requires efforts to mitigate potential access barriers and mistrust. We call for more visualization professionals to help build civic capacity by working in and studying political systems.",What Can Interactive Visualization do for Participatory Budgeting in Chicago?,,T&E,2024
"Data tables are one of the most common ways in which people encounter data. Although mostly built with text and numbers, data tables have a spatial layout and often exhibit visual elements meant to facilitate their reading. Surprisingly, there is an empirical knowledge gap on how people read and use tables and how different visual aids affect people's ability to use them. In this work, we seek to address this vacuum through a controlled study. We asked participants to repeatedly perform four different tasks with tables in four table representation conditions (plain tables, tables with zebra striping, tables with cell background color encoding cell value, and tables with background bar length in a cell encoding cell value). We analyzed completion time, error rate, gaze-tracking data, mouse movement and participant preferences. We found that visual encodings help for finding maximum values (especially color), but not as much as zebra striping helps in a complex task (comparison of proportional differences). We also characterize typical human behavior for the different tasks. These findings can inform the design of tables and research directions for improving presentation of data in tabular form.",The Effect of Visual Aids on Reading Numeric Data Tables,,T&E,2024
"Visualization linters are end-user facing evaluators that automatically identify potential chart issues. These spell-checker like systems offer a blend of interpretability and customization that is not found in other forms of automated assistance. However, existing linters do not model context and have primarily targeted users who do not need assistance, resulting in obvious---even annoying---advice. We investigate these issues within the domain of color palette design, which serves as a microcosm of visualization design concerns. We contribute a GUI-based color palette linter as a design probe that covers perception, accessibility, context, and other design criteria, and use it to explore visual explanations, integrated fixes, and user-defined linting rules. Through a formative interview study and theory-driven analysis, we find that linters can be meaningfully integrated into graphical contexts  thereby addressing many of their core issues.  We discuss implications for integrating linters into visualization tools, developing improved assertion languages, and supporting end-user tunable advice---all laying the groundwork for more effective visualization linters in any context.",Mixing Linters with GUIs: A Color Palette Design Probe,,R&I,2024
"Emotion is an important factor to consider when designing visualizations as it can impact the amount of trust viewers place in a visualization, how well they can retrieve information and understand the underlying data, and how much they engage with or connect to a visualization. We conducted five crowdsourced experiments to quantify the effects of color, chart type, data trend, data variability and data density on emotion (measured through self-reported arousal and valence). Results from our experiments show that there are multiple design elements which influence the emotion induced by a visualization and, more surprisingly, that certain data characteristics influence the emotion of viewers even when the data has no meaning. In light of these findings, we offer guidelines on how to use color, scale, and chart type to counterbalance and emphasize the emotional impact of immutable data characteristics.",Quantifying Emotional Responses to Immutable Data Characteristics and Designer Choices in Data Visualizations,,T&E,2024
"Annotations play a vital role in highlighting critical aspects of visualizations, aiding in data externalization and exploration, collaborative data analysis, and visual storytelling. However, despite their widespread use, we identified a lack of a design space for common practices for annotations. In this paper, we evaluated over 1,800 static annotated charts to understand how people annotate visualizations in practice. Through qualitative coding of these diverse real-world annotated charts, we explore three primary aspects of annotation usage patterns: analytic purposes for chart annotations (e.g., present, identify, summarize, or compare data features), mechanisms for chart annotations (e.g., types and combinations of annotations used, frequency of different annotation types across chart types, etc.), and the data source used to generate the annotations. We then synthesized our findings into a design space of annotations, highlighting key design choices for chart annotations. We presented three case studies illustrating our design space as a practical framework for chart annotations to enhance the communication of visualization insights.",A Qualitative Analysis of Common Practices in Annotations: A Taxonomy and Design Space,,T&E,2024
"We present the results of an exploratory study on how pairs interact with speech commands and touch gestures on a wall-sized display during a collaborative sensemaking task. Previous work has shown that speech commands, alone or in combination with other input modalities, can support visual data exploration by individuals. However, it is still unknown whether and how speech commands can be used in collaboration, and for what tasks. To answer these questions, we developed a functioning prototype that we used as a technology probe. We conducted an in-depth exploratory study with 20 participants (10 pairs) to analyze their interaction choices, the interplay between the input modalities, and their collaboration. While touch was the most used modality, we found that participants preferred speech commands for global operations, used them for distant interaction, and that speech interaction contributed to the awareness of the partner’s actions. Furthermore, the likelihood of using speech commands during collaboration was related to the personality trait of agreeableness. Regarding collaboration styles, participants interacted with speech equally often whether they were in loosely or closely coupled collaboration. While the partners stood closer to each other during close collaboration, they did not walk away from their partner to use speech commands. From our findings, we derive and contribute a set of design considerations for collaborative and multimodal interactive data analysis systems.",Talk to the Wall: The Role of Speech Interaction in Collaborative Visual Analytics,,R&I,2024
"Building information modeling (BIM) describes a central data pool covering the entire life cycle of a construction project. Similarly, building energy modeling (BEM) describes the process of using a 3D representation of a building as a basis for thermal simulations to assess the building’s energy performance.

BEMTrace integrates 3D data wrangling techniques with visualization methodologies to enhance the accuracy and traceability of the BIM-to-BEM conversion process. Through parsing, error detection, and algorithmic correction of BIM data, our methods generate valid BEM models suitable for energy simulation. Visualization techniques provide transparent insights into the conversion process, aiding error identification, validation, and user comprehension. We introduce context-adaptive selections to facilitate user interaction and understanding throughout the conversion process. By evaluating user feedback, we could show that BEMTrace can solve domain-specific tasks.",BEMTrace: Visualization-driven approach for deriving Building Energy Models from BIM,,App,2024
"Visualizations play a critical role in validating and improving statistical models. However, the design space of model check visualizations is not well understood, making it difficult for authors to explore and specify effective graphical model checks. VMC defines a model check visualization using four components: (1) samples of distributions of checkable quantities generated from the model, including predictive distributions for new data and distributions of model parameters; (2) transformations on observed data to facilitate comparison; (3) visual representations of distributions; and (4) layouts to facilitate comparing model samples and observed data. We contribute an implementation of VMC as an R package. We validate VMC by reproducing a set of canonical model check examples, and show how using VMC to generate model checks reduces the edit distance between visualizations relative to existing visualization toolkits. The findings of an interview study with three expert modelers who used VMC highlight challenges and opportunities for encouraging exploration of correct, effective model check visualizations.",VMC: A Grammar for Visualizing Statistical Model Checks,,App,2024
"We apply an approach from cognitive linguistics by mapping Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT) to the visualization domain to address patterns of visual conceptual metaphors that are often used in science infographics. Metaphors play an essential part in visual communication and are frequently employed to explain complex concepts. However, their use is often based on intuition, rather than following a formal process. At present, we lack tools and language for understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent where taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g., infographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within scientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in existing scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this mapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains (biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range of visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science. This work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use within the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors are used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in scientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational conceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex scientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory tool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on a spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual metaphors.",The Language of Infographics: Toward Understanding Conceptual Metaphor Use in Scientific Storytelling,,T&E,2024
"In this study, we address the growing issue of misleading charts, a prevalent problem that undermines the integrity of information dissemination. Misleading charts can distort the viewer's perception of data, leading to misinterpretations and decisions based on false information. The development of effective automatic detection methods for misleading charts is an urgent field of research. The advancement of multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced a promising direction for addressing this challenge. We explored the capabilities of these models in analyzing complex charts and assessing the impact of different prompting strategies on the models' analyses. We utilized a dataset of misleading charts collected from the internet by prior research and crafted nine distinct prompts, ranging from simple to complex, to test the ability of four different multimodal LLMs in detecting over 21 different chart issues. Through three experiments--from initial exploration to detailed analysis--we progressively gained insights into how to effectively prompt LLMs to identify misleading charts and developed strategies to address the scalability challenges encountered as we expanded our detection range from the initial five issues to 21 issues in the final experiment. Our findings reveal that multimodal LLMs possess a strong capability for chart comprehension and critical thinking in data interpretation. There is significant potential in employing multimodal LLMs to counter misleading information by supporting critical thinking and enhancing visualization literacy. This study demonstrates their applicability in addressing the pressing concern of misleading charts.",How Good (Or Bad) Are LLMs in Detecting Misleading Visualizations,,T&E,2024
"Dynamic data visualizations can convey large amounts of information over time, such as using motion to depict changes in data values for multiple entities. Such dynamic displays put a demand on our visual processing capacities, yet our perception of motion is limited. When tracking multiple objects across space and time, humans can typically track up to four objects, and the capacity is even lower if we also need to remember the history of the objects’ features. Several techniques have been shown to improve the processing of dynamic displays. Staging the animation to sequentially show steps in a transition and tracing object movement by displaying trajectory histories can increase processing by reducing the cognitive load. In this paper, We examine the effectiveness of staging and tracing in dynamic displays. We showed participants animated line charts depicting the movements of lines and asked them to identify the line with the highest mean and variance. We manipulated the animation to display the lines with or without staging, tracing and history, and compared the results to a static chart as a control. Results showed that tracing and staging are preferred by participants, and improve their performance in mean and variance tasks respectively. The preferred display time 3 times shorter when staging is used. Also, encoding animation speed with mean and variance in congruent tasks is associated with higher accuracy. These findings help inform real-world best practices for building dynamic displays that leverage the strength of humans' visual processing.",Motion-Based Visual Encoding Can Improve Performance on Perceptual Tasks with Dynamic Time Series,,T&E,2024
"Evaluating the quality of text responses generated by large language models (LLMs) poses unique challenges compared to traditional machine learning. While automatic side-by-side evaluation has emerged as a promising approach, LLM developers face scalability and interpretability challenges in analyzing these evaluation results. In this paper, we present LLM Comparator, a novel visual analytics tool for interactively analyzing results from side-by-side evaluation of LLMs. The tool provides users with interactive workflows to understand when and why a model performs better or worse than a baseline model, and how the responses from two models differ qualitatively. We iteratively designed and developed the tool by closely working with researchers and engineers at a large technology company. Qualitative feedback from users highlights that the tool facilitates in-depth analysis of individual examples while enabling users to visually overview and flexibly slice data.

"The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), especially ChatGPT, into education is poised to revolutionize students' learning experiences by introducing innovative conversational learning methodologies. To empower students to fully leverage the capabilities of ChatGPT in educational scenarios, understanding students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT is crucial for instructors. However, this endeavor is challenging due to the absence of datasets focused on student-ChatGPT conversations and the complexities in identifying and analyzing the evolutional interaction patterns within conversations. To address these challenges, we collected conversational data from 48 students interacting with ChatGPT in a master's level data visualization course over one semester. We then developed a coding scheme, grounded in the literature on cognitive levels and thematic analysis, to categorize students' interaction patterns with ChatGPT. Furthermore, we present a visual analytics system, StuGPTViz, that tracks and compares temporal patterns in student prompts and the quality of ChatGPT's responses at multiple scales, revealing significant pedagogical insights for instructors. We validated the system's effectiveness through expert interviews with six data visualization instructors and three case studies.

"Translating natural language to visualization (NL2VIS) has shown great promise for visual data analysis, but it remains a challenging task that requires multiple low-level implementations, such as natural language processing and visualization design. Recent advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are opening new avenues for generating visualizations from natural language. However, the lack of a comprehensive and reliable benchmark hinders our understanding of LLMs’ capabilities in visualization generation. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new NL2VIS benchmark called VisEval. Firstly, we introduce a high-quality and large-scale dataset. This dataset includes 2,524 representative queries covering 146 databases, paired with accurately labeled ground truths. Secondly, we advocate for a comprehensive automated evaluation methodology covering multiple dimensions, including validity, legality, and readability. By systematically scanning for potential issues with a number of heterogeneous checkers, VisEval provides reliable and trustworthy evaluation outcomes.

"Data videos increasingly becoming a popular data storytelling form represented by visual and audio integration. In recent years, more and more researchers have explored many narrative structures for effective and attractive data storytelling. Meanwhile, the Hero's Journey provides a classic narrative framework specific to the Hero's story that has been adopted by various mediums. There are continuous discussions about applying Hero's Journey to data stories. However, so far, little systematic and practical guidance on how to create a data video for a specific story type like the Hero's Journey, as well as how to manipulate its sound and visual designs simultaneously. To fulfill this gap, we first identified 48 data videos aligned with the Hero's Journey as the common storytelling from 109 high-quality data videos. Then, we examined how existing practices apply Hero's Journey for creating data videos. We coded the 48 data videos in terms of the narrative stages, sound design, and visual design according to the Hero's Journey structure. Based on our findings, we proposed a design space to provide practical guidance on the narrative, visual, and sound custom design for different narrative segments of the hero's journey (i.e., Departure, Initiation, Return) through data video creation. To validate our proposed design space, we conducted a user study where 20 participants were invited to design data videos with and without our design space guidance, which was evaluated by two experts. Results show that our design space provides useful and practical guidance for data storytellers effectively creating data videos with the Hero's Journey.",Telling Data Stories with the Hero’s Journey: Design Guidance for Creating Data Videos,,T&E,2024

Beyond off-the-shelf tools for data exploration, there is an increasing need for platforms that aid experts in authoring customized visualizations for both exploration and communication of insights. A variety of interactive techniques have been proposed for authoring data visualizations, such as template editing, shelf configuration, natural language input, and code editors. However, it remains unclear how genomics experts create visualizations and which techniques best support their visualization tasks and needs. To address this gap, we conducted two user studies with genomics researchers: (1) semi-structured interviews (n=20) to identify the tasks, user contexts, and current visualization authoring techniques and (2) an exploratory study (n=13) using visual probes to elicit users’ intents and desired techniques when creating visualizations. Our contributions include (1) a characterization of how visualization authoring is currently utilized in genomics visualization, identifying limitations and benefits in light of common criteria for authoring tools, and (2) generalizable and actionable design implications for genomics visualization authoring tools based on our findings on task- and user-specific usefulness of authoring techniques.",Understanding Visualization Authoring Techniques for Genomics Data in the Context of Personas and Tasks,,T&E,2024
"As basketball’s popularity surges, fans often find themselves confused and overwhelmed by the rapid game pace and complexity. Basketball tactics, involving a complex series of actions, require substantial knowledge to be fully understood. This complexity leads to a need for additional information and explanation, which can distract fans from the game. To tackle these challenges, we present Sportify, a Visual Question Answering system that integrates narratives and embedded visualization for demystifying basketball tactical questions, aiding fans in understanding various game aspects. We propose three novel action visualizations (i.e., Pass, Cut, and Screen) to demonstrate critical action sequences. To explain the reasoning and logic behind players’ actions, we leverage a large-language model (LLM) to generate narratives. We adopt a storytelling approach for complex scenarios from both first and third-person perspectives, integrating action visualizations. We evaluated Sportify with basketball fans to investigate its impact on understanding of tactics, and how different personal perspectives of narratives impact the understanding of complex tactic with action visualizations. Our evaluation with basketball fans demonstrates Sportify’s capability to deepen tactical insights and amplify the viewing experience. Furthermore, third-person narration assists people in getting in-depth game explanations while first-person narration enhances fans’ game engagement.",Sportify: Question Answering with Embedded Visualizations and Personified Narratives for Sports Video,,App,2024
"Data visualization aids in making data analysis more intuitive and in-depth, with widespread applications in fields such as biology, finance, and medicine. For massive and continuously growing streaming time series data, these data are typically visualized in the form of line charts, but the data transmission puts significant pressure on the network, leading to visualization lag or even fail to render completely. This paper proposes a universal sampling algorithm FPCS, which retains feature points from continuously received streaming time series data, compensates for the frequent fluctuating feature points, and aims to achieve efficient visualization. This algorithm bridges the gap in sampling for streaming time series data. The algorithm has several advantages: (1) It optimizes the sampling results by compensating for fewer feature points, retaining the visualization features of the original data very well, ensuring high-quality sampled data; (2) The execution time is the shortest compared to similar existing algorithms; (3) It has an almost negligible space overhead; (4) The data sampling process does not depend on the overall data; (5) This algorithm can be applied to infinite streaming data and finite static data.",FPCS: Feature Preserving Compensated Sampling of Streaming Time Series Data,,DTr,2024
"Synthetic Lethal (SL) relationships, although rare among the vast array of gene combinations, hold substantial promise for targeted cancer therapy. Despite advancements in AI model accuracy, there remains a persistent need among domain experts for interpretive paths and mechanism explorations that better harmonize with domain-specific knowledge, particularly due to the significant costs involved in experimentation. To address this gap, we propose an iterative Human-AI collaborative framework comprising two key components: 1)Human-Engaged Knowledge Graph Refinement based on Metapath Strategies, which leverages insights from interpretive paths and domain expertise to refine the knowledge graph through metapath strategies with appropriate granularity. 2)Cross-Granularity SL Interpretation Enhancement and Mechanism Analysis, which aids domain experts in organizing and comparing prediction results and interpretive paths across different granularities, thereby uncovering new SL relationships, enhancing result interpretation, and elucidating potential mechanisms inferred by Graph Neural Network (GNN) models. These components cyclically optimize model predictions and mechanism explorations, thereby enhancing expert involvement and intervention to build trust. This framework, facilitated by SLInterpreter, ensures that newly generated interpretive paths increasingly align with domain knowledge and adhere more closely to real-world biological principles through iterative Human-AI collaboration.

"In volume visualization, visualization synthesis has attracted much attention due to its ability to generate novel visualizations without following the conventional rendering pipeline. However, existing solutions based on generative adversarial networks often require many training images and take significant training time. Still, issues such as low quality, consistency, and flexibility persist. This paper introduces StyleRF-VolVis, an innovative style transfer framework for expressive volume visualization (VolVis) via neural radiance field (NeRF). The expressiveness of StyleRF-VolVis is upheld by its ability to accurately separate the underlying scene geometry (i.e., content) and color appearance (i.e., style), conveniently modify color, opacity, and lighting of the original rendering while maintaining visual content consistency across the views, and effectively transfer arbitrary styles from reference images to the reconstructed 3D scene. To achieve these, we design a base NeRF model for scene geometry extraction, a palette color network to classify regions of the radiance field for photorealistic editing, and an unrestricted color network to lift the color palette constraint via knowledge distillation for non-photorealistic editing. We demonstrate the superior quality, consistency, and flexibility of StyleRF-VolVis by experimenting with various volume rendering scenes and reference images and comparing StyleRF-VolVis against other image-based (AdaIN), video-based (ReReVST), and NeRF-based (ARF and SNeRF) style rendering solutions.",StyleRF-VolVis: Style Transfer of Neural Radiance Fields for Expressive Volume Visualization,,R&I,2024

However, design guidance on how to best address these issues is currently lacking. We conducted design sessions with eight professional designers and developers of web-based thematic maps for information visualization. Participants were asked to redesign a given map for various screen sizes and aspect ratios and to describe their reasoning for when and how they adapted the design. We report general observations of practitioners’ motivations, decision-making processes, and personal design frameworks. We then derive seven challenges commonly encountered in responsive map design, and 17 strategies to address them, such as repositioning elements, segmenting the map, or using alternative visualizations. We compile these challenges and strategies into an illustrated cheat sheet targeted at anyone designing or learning to design responsive maps. The cheat sheet is available online: https://responsive-vis.github.io/map-cheat-sheet.",Practices and Strategies in Responsive Thematic Map Design: A Report from Design Workshops with Experts,,R&I,2024
"This paper presents discursive patinas, a technique to visualize discussions onto data visualizations, inspired by how people leave traces in the physical world. While data visualizations are widely discussed in online communities and social media, comments tend to be displayed separately from the visualization. We lack ways to relate these discussions to the content of the visualization, e.g., to situate comments, explain visual patterns, or question assumptions. In our visualization annotation interface, users can designate areas within the visualization to, e.g., highlight specific visual marks (anchors), attach textual comments, and add category labels, likes, and replies. By coloring and styling these designated areas, a meta visualization emerges, showing what and where people comment and annotate. These patinas show regions of heavy discussions, recent commenting activity, and the distribution of questions, suggestions, or personal stories. To study how people use anchors to discuss visualizations and understand if and how information in patinas influence people's understanding of the discussion, we ran workshops with 90 participants including students, domain experts, and visualization researchers. Our results show that discursive patinas improve the ability to navigate discussions and guide people to comments that help understand, contextualize, or scrutinize the visualization. We discuss the potential of the technique to support discursive engagements, including critical readings of visualizations, design feedback, and feminist approaches to data visualization.",Discursive Patinas: Anchoring Discussions in Data Visualizations,,R&I,2024
"Onboarding a user to a visualization dashboard entails explaining its various components, including the chart types used, the data loaded, and the interactions provided. Authoring such an onboarding experience is time-consuming and requires significant knowledge, and little guidance exists on how best to do this. End-users being onboarded to a new dashboard can be either confused and overwhelmed, or disinterested and disengaged, depending on the user’s expertise. We propose interactive dashboard tours (d-tours) as semi-automated onboarding experiences for variable user expertise that preserve the user’s agency, interest, and engagement. Our interactive tours concept draws from open-world game design to give the user freedom in choosing their path in the onboarding. We have implemented the concept in a tool called D-TOUR PROTOTYPE that allows authors to craft custom and interactive dashboard tours from scratch or using automatic templates. Automatically generated tours can still be customized to use different media (such as video, audio, or highlighting) or new narratives to produce a tailored onboarding experience for individual users or groups. We demonstrate the usefulness of interactive dashboard tours through use cases and expert interviews.   The evaluation shows that the authors find the automation in the DTour prototype helpful and time-saving and the users find it engaging and intuitive.

"Visualization designers often rely on examples to explore the space of possible designs, yet we have little insight into how examples shape data visualization design outcomes. While the effects of examples have been studied in other disciplines, such as web design or engineering, the results are not readily applicable to visualization design due to inconsistencies in findings and challenges unique to visualization design. Towards bridging this gap, we conduct an exploratory experiment involving 32 data visualization designers focusing on the influence of five factors (timing, quantity, diversity, data topic similarity, and data schema similarity) on objectively measurable design outcomes (e.g., numbers of designs and idea transfers). Our quantitative analysis shows that when examples are introduced after initial brainstorming, designers curate examples with topics less similar to the dataset they are working on and produce more designs with a high variation in visualization components. Also, designers copy more ideas from examples with higher data schema similarities. Our qualitative analysis of participants’ thought processes provides insights into why designers incorporate examples into their designs, revealing potential factors that have not been previously investigated. Finally, we discuss how our results inform future work on quantifying designs, improving measures of effectiveness, and supporting example-based visualization design.

"Various data visualization downstream applications such as reverse engineering and interactive authoring require a vocabulary that describes the structure of visualization scenes and the procedure to manipulate them. A few scene abstractions have been proposed, but they are restricted to specific applications for a limited set of visualization types. A unified and expressive model of data visualization scenes for different downstream applications has been missing. To fill this gap, we present Manipulable Semantic Components (MSC), a computational representation of data visualization scenes, to support applications in scene understanding and augmentation. MSC consists of two parts: a unified object model describing the structure of a visualization scene in terms of semantic components, and a set of operations to generate and modify the scene components. We demonstrate the benefits of MSC in three applications: visualization authoring, visualization deconstruction and reuse, and animation specification.",Manipulable Semantic Components: a Computational Representation of Data Visualization Scenes,,T&E,2024
"Visualization items—factual questions about visualizations that ask viewers to accomplish visualization tasks—are regularly used in the field of information visualization as educational and evaluative materials. For example, researchers of visualization literacy require large, diverse banks of items to conduct studies where the same skill is measured repeatedly on the same participants. Yet, generating a large number of high-quality, diverse items requires significant time and expertise. To address the critical need for a large number of diverse visualization items in education and research, this paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of multiple-choice visualization items. Through an iterative design process, we develop an LLM-based pipeline, the VILA (Visualization Items Generated by Large LAnguage Models) pipeline, for efficiently generating visualization items that measure people’s ability to accomplish visualization tasks. We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is a final bank, the VILA bank, of ∼1,100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of LLMs in generating visualization items, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people’s ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; to show the potential of this application, we assess the convergent validity of VILA-VLAT by comparing it to the existing test VLAT via an online study (R = 0.70). Lastly, we discuss the application areas of the VILA pipeline and the VILA bank and provide practical recommendations for their use.

"Comics have been shown to be an effective method for sequential data-driven storytelling, especially for dynamic graphs that change over time. However, manually creating a data-driven comic for a dynamic graph is currently time-consuming, complex, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose DG Comics, a novel comic authoring tool for dynamic graphs that allows users to semi-automatically build the comic and annotate it. The tool uses a hierarchical clustering algorithm that we newly developed for segmenting consecutive snapshots of the dynamic graph while preserving their chronological order. It also provides rich information on both individuals and communities extracted from dynamic graphs in multiple views, where users can explore dynamic graphs and choose what to tell in comics. For evaluation, we provide an example and report results from a user study and expert review.",DG Comics: Semi-Automatically Authoring Graph Comics for Dynamic Graphs,,App,2024
"Numerical simulation serves as a cornerstone in scientific modeling, yet the process of fine-tuning simulation parameters poses significant challenges. Conventionally, parameter adjustment relies on extensive numerical simulations, data analysis, and expert insights, resulting in substantial computational costs and low efficiency. The emergence of deep learning in recent years has provided promising avenues for more efficient exploration of parameter spaces. However, existing approaches often lack intuitive methods for precise parameter adjustment and optimization. To tackle these challenges, we introduce ParamsDrag, a model that facilitates parameter space exploration through direct interaction with visualizations. Inspired by DragGAN, our ParamsDrag model operates in three steps. First, the generative component of ParamsDrag generates visualizations based on the input simulation parameters. Second, by directly dragging structure-related features in the visualizations, users can intuitively understand the controlling effect of different parameters. Third, with the understanding from the earlier step, users can steer ParamsDrag to produce dynamic visual outcomes. Through experiments conducted on real-world simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art deep learning based approaches, we demonstrate the efficacy of our solution.",ParamsDrag: Interactive Parameter Space Exploration via Image-Space Dragging,,S&R,2024
"Differential privacy ensures the security of individual privacy but poses challenges to data exploration processes because the limited privacy budget incapacitates the flexibility of exploration and the noisy feedback of data requests leads to confusing uncertainty. In this study, we take the lead in describing corresponding exploration scenarios, including underlying requirements and available exploration strategies. To facilitate practical applications, we propose a visual analysis approach to the formulation of exploration strategies. Our approach applies a reinforcement learning model to provide diverse suggestions for exploration strategies according to the exploration intent of users. A novel visual design for representing uncertainty in correlation patterns is integrated into our prototype system to support the proposed approach. Finally, we implemented a user study and two case studies. The results of these studies verified that our approach can help develop strategies that satisfy the exploration intent of users.",Defogger: A Visual Analysis Approach for Data Exploration of Sensitive Data Protected by Differential Privacy,,A&D,2024
"We are currently witnessing an increase in web-based, data-driven initiatives that explain complex, contemporary issues through data and visualizations: climate change, sustainability, AI, or cultural discoveries. Many of these projects call themselves ""atlases"", a term that historically referred to collections of maps or scientific illustrations. To answer the question of what makes a ""visualization atlas"", we conducted a systematic analysis of 33 visualization atlases and semi-structured interviews with eight visualization atlas creators. Based on our results, we contribute (1) a definition of visualization atlases as an emerging format to present complex topics in a holistic, data-driven, and curated way through visualization, (2) a set of design patterns and design dimensions that led to (3) defining 5 visualization atlas genres, and (4) insights into the atlas creation from interviews. We found that visualization atlases are unique in that they combine exploratory visualization with narrative elements from data-driven storytelling and structured navigation mechanisms. They can act as a reference, communication or discovery tools targeting a wide range of audiences with different levels of domain knowledge. We conclude with a discussion of current design practices and emerging questions around the ethics and potential real-world impact of visualization atlases, aimed to inform the design and study of visualization atlases.","Visualization Atlases: Explaining and Exploring Complex Topics through Data, Visualization, and Narration",,R&I,2024
"We present a systematic review, an empirical study, and a first set of considerations for designing visualizations in motion, derived from a concrete scenario in which these visualizations were used to support a primary task. In practice, when viewers are confronted with embedded visualizations, they often have to focus on a primary task and can only quickly glance at a visualization showing rich, often dynamically updated, information. As such, the visualizations must be designed so as not to distract from the primary task, while at the same time being readable and useful for aiding the primary task. For example, in games, players who are engaged in a battle have to look at their enemies but also read the remaining health of their own game character from the health bar over their character's head. Many trade-offs are possible in the design of embedded visualizations in such dynamic scenarios, which we explore in-depth in this paper with a focus on user experience. We use video games as an example of an application context with a rich existing set of visualizations in motion. We begin our work with a systematic review of in-game visualizations in motion. Next, we conduct an empirical user study to investigate how different embedded visualizations in motion designs impact user experience. We conclude with a set of considerations and trade-offs for designing visualizations in motion more broadly as derived from what we learned about video games.

"This paper presents a practical approach for the optimization of topological simplification, a central pre-processing step for the analysis and visualization of scalar data. Given an input scalar field f and a set of “signal” persistence pairs to maintain, our approaches produces an output field g that is close to f and which optimizes (i) the cancellation of “non-signal” pairs, while (ii) preserving the “signal” pairs. In contrast to pre-existing simplification approaches, our method is not restricted to persistence pairs involving extrema and can thus address a larger class of topological features, in particular saddle pairs in three-dimensional scalar data. Our approach leverages recent generic persistence optimization frameworks and extends them with tailored accelerations specific to the problem of topological simplification. Extensive experiments report substantial accelerations over these frameworks, thereby making topological simplification optimization practical for real-life datasets. Our work enables a direct visualization and analysis of the topologically simplified data, e.g., via isosurfaces of simplified topology (fewer components and handles). We apply our approach to the extraction of prominent filament structures in three-dimensional data. Specifically, we show that our pre-simplification of the data leads to practical improvements over standard topological techniques for removing filament loops. We also show how our framework can be used to repair genus defects in surface processing. Finally, we provide a C++ implementation for reproducibility purposes.",A Practical Solver for Scalar Data Topological Simplification,,DTr,2024
"Trained on vast corpora, Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to encode visualization design knowledge and best practices. However, if they fail to do so, they might provide unreliable visualization recommendations. What visualization design preferences, then, have LLMs learned? We contribute DracoGPT, an approach for extracting and modeling visualization design preferences from LLMs. To assess varied tasks, we develop two pipelines---DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend---to model LLMs prompted to either rank or recommend visual encoding specifications. We use Draco as a shared knowledge base in which to represent LLM design preferences and compare them to best practices from empirical research. We demonstrate that DracoGPT models the preferences expressed by LLMs well, enabling analysis in terms of Draco design constraints. Across a suite of backing LLMs, we find that DracoGPT-Rank and DracoGPT-Recommend moderately agree with each other, but both substantively diverge from guidelines drawn from human subjects experiments. Future work can build on our approach to expand Draco's knowledge base to model a richer set of preferences and serve as a reliable and cost-effective stand-in for LLMs.",DracoGPT: Extracting Visualization Design Preferences from Large Language Models,,T&E,2024
"Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Prompt Engineering have made chatbot customization more accessible, significantly reducing barriers to tasks that previously required programming skills. However, prompt evaluation, especially at the dataset scale, remains complex due to the need to assess prompts across thousands of test instances within a dataset. Our study, based on a comprehensive literature review and pilot study, summarized five critical challenges in prompt evaluation. In response, we introduce a feature-oriented workflow for systematic prompt evaluation, focusing on text summarization. Our workflow advocates feature metrics such as complexity, formality, or naturalness, instead of using traditional quality metrics like ROUGE. This design choice enables a more user-friendly evaluation of prompts, as it guides users in sorting through the ambiguity inherent in natural language. To support this workflow, we introduce Awesum, a visual analytics system that facilitates identifying optimal prompt refinements through interactive visualizations, featuring a novel Prompt Comparator design that employs a BubbleSet-inspired design enhanced by dimensionality reduction techniques. We evaluate the effectiveness and general applicability of the system with practitioners from various domains and found that (1) our design helps overcome the learning curve for non-technical people to conduct a systematic evaluation, and (2) our feature-oriented workflow has the potential to generalize to other NLG and image-generation tasks. For future works, we advocate moving towards feature-oriented evaluation of LLM prompts and discuss unsolved challenges in terms of human-agent interaction.",Towards Dataset-scale and Feature-oriented Evaluation of Text Summarization in Large Language Model Prompts,,A&D,2024
"We propose the notion of Attention-aware Visualizations (AAVs) that track the user's perception of a visual representation over time and feed this information back to the visualization.This idea is particularly useful for ubiquitous and immersive analytics where knowing which embedded visualizations the user is looking at can be used to make visualizations react appropriately to the user's attention: for example, by highlighting data the user has not yet seen. We can separate the approach into three components: (1) measuring the user's gaze on a visualization and its parts; (2) tracking the user's attention over time; and (3) reactively modifying the visual representation based on the current attention metric. In this paper, we present two separate implementations of AAV: a 2D numeric integration of attention for web-based visualizations that can use an embodied eye-tracker to capture the user's gaze, and a 3D implementation that uses the stencil buffer to track the visibility of each individual mark in a visualization. Both methods provide similar mechanisms for accumulating attention over time and changing the appearance of marks in response. We also present results from a controlled laboratory experiment studying different visual feedback mechanisms for attention.",Attention-Aware Visualization: Tracking and Responding to User Perception Over Time,,R&I,2024
"Egocentric networks, often visualized as node-link diagrams, portray the complex relationship (link) dynamics between an entity (node) and others. However, common analytics tasks are multifaceted, encompassing interactions among four key aspects: strength, function, structure, and content. Current node-link visualization designs may fall short, focusing narrowly on certain aspects and neglecting the holistic, dynamic nature of egocentric networks.  To bridge this gap, we introduce SpreadLine, a novel visualization framework designed to enable the visual exploration of egocentric networks from these four aspects at the microscopic level.  Leveraging the intuitive appeal of storyline visualizations, SpreadLine adopts a storyline-based design to represent entities and their evolving relationships. We further encode essential topological information in the layout and condense the contextual information in a metro map metaphor, allowing for a more engaging and effective way to explore temporal and attribute-based information. To guide our work, with a thorough review of pertinent literature, we have distilled a task taxonomy that addresses the analytical needs specific to egocentric network exploration.  Acknowledging the diverse analytical requirements of users, SpreadLine offers customizable encodings to enable users to tailor the framework for their tasks.  We demonstrate the efficacy and general applicability of SpreadLine through three diverse real-world case studies and a usability study.",SpreadLine: Visualizing Egocentric Dynamic Influence,,R&I,2024
"Referential gestures, or as termed in linguistics, {\em deixis}, are an essential part of communication around data visualizations. Despite their importance, such gestures are often overlooked when documenting data analysis meetings. Transcripts, for instance, fail to capture gestures, and video recordings may not adequately capture or emphasize them. We introduce a novel method for documenting collaborative data meetings that treats deixis as a first-class citizen. Our proposed framework captures cursor-based gestural data along with audio and converts them into interactive documents. The framework leverages a large language model to identify word correspondences with gestures. These identified references are used to create context-based annotations in the resulting interactive document. We assess the effectiveness of our proposed method through a user study, finding that participants preferred our automated interactive documentation over recordings, transcripts, and manual note-taking. Furthermore, we derive a preliminary taxonomy of cursor-based deictic gestures from participant actions during the study. This taxonomy offers further opportunities for better utilizing cursor-based deixis in collaborative data analysis scenarios.",A Deixis-Centered Approach for Documenting Remote Synchronous Communication around Data Visualizations,,A&D,2024
"A year ago, we submitted an IEEE VIS paper entitled “Swaying the Public? Impacts of Election Forecast Visualizations on Emotion, Trust, and Intention in the 2022 U.S. Midterms” [68], which was later bestowed with the honor of a best paper award. Yet, studying such a complex phenomenon required us to explore many more design paths than we could count, and certainly more than we could document in a single paper. This paper, then, is the unwritten prequel—the backstory. It chronicles our journey from a simple idea—to study visualizations for election forecasts—through obstacles such as developing meaningfully different, easy-to-understand forecast visualizations, crafting professional-looking forecasts, and grappling with how to study perceptions of the forecasts before, during, and after the 2022 U.S. midterm elections. Our backstory began with developing a design space for two-party election forecasts, deﬁning dimensions such as data transformations, visual channels, layouts, and types of animated narratives. We then qualitatively evaluated ten representative prototypes in this design space through interviews with 13 participants. The interviews yielded invaluable insights into how people interpret uncertainty visualizations and reason about probability in a U.S. election context, such as confounding win probability with vote share and erroneously forming connections between concrete visual representations (like dots) and real-world entities (like votes). Informed by these insights, we revised our prototypes to address ambiguity in interpreting visual encodings, particularly through the inclusion of extensive annotations. As we navigated these design paths, we contributed a design space and insights that may help others when designing uncertainty visualizations. We also hope that our design lessons and research process can inspire the research community when exploring topics related to designing visualizations for the general public.",The Backstory to “Swaying the Public”: A Design Chronicle of Election Forecast Visualizations,,R&I,2024
"Projecting high-dimensional vectors into two dimensions for visualization, known as embedding visualization, facilitates perceptual reasoning and interpretation. Comparison of multiple embedding visualizations drives decision-making in many domains, but conventional comparison methods are limited by a reliance on direct point correspondences. This requirement precludes embedding comparisons without point correspondences, such as two different datasets of annotated images, and fails to capture meaningful higher-level relationships among point groups. To address these shortcomings, we propose a general framework to compare embedding visualizations based on shared class labels rather than individual points. Our approach partitions points into regions corresponding to three key class concepts---confusion, neighborhood, and relative size---to characterize intra- and inter-class relationships. Informed by a preliminary user study, we realize an implementation of our framework using perceptual neighborhood graphs to define these regions and introduce metrics to quantify each concept. We demonstrate the generality of our framework with use cases from machine learning and single-cell biology, highlighting our metrics' ability to surface insightful comparisons across label hierarchies. To assess the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted a user study with five machine learning researchers and six single-cell biologists using an interactive and scalable prototype developed in Python and Rust. Our metrics enable more structured comparison through visual guidance and increased participants’ confidence in their findings.",A General Framework for Comparing Embedding Visualizations Across Class-Label Hierarchies,,A&D,2024
"Topological abstractions offer a method to summarize the behavior of vector fields, but computing them robustly can be challenging due to numerical precision issues. One alternative is to represent the vector field using a discrete approach, which constructs a collection of pairs of simplices in the input mesh that satisfies criteria introduced by Forman’s discrete Morse theory. While numerous approaches exist to compute pairs in the restricted case of the gradient of a scalar field, state-of-the-art algorithms for the general case of vector fields require expensive optimization procedures. This paper introduces a fast, novel approach for pairing simplices of two-dimensional, triangulated vector fields that do not vary in time. The key insight of our approach is that we can employ a local evaluation, inspired by the approach used to construct a discrete gradient field, where every cell in a mesh is considered by no more than one of its vertices. Specifically, we observe that for any edge in the input mesh, we can uniquely assign an outward direction of flow. We can further expand this consistent notion of outward flow at each vertex, which corresponds to the concept of a downhill flow in the case of scalar fields. Working with outward flow enables a linear-time algorithm that processes the (outward) neighborhoods of each vertex one-by-one, similar to the approach used for scalar fields. We couple our approach to constructing discrete vector fields with a method to extract, simplify, and visualize topological features. Empirical results on analytic and simulation data demonstrate drastic improvements in running time, produce features similar to the current state-of-the-art, and show the application of simplification to large, complex flows.",Localized Evaluation for Constructing Discrete Vector Fields,,DTr,2024
"Haptic feedback provides an essential sensory stimulus crucial for interacting and analyzing three-dimensional spatio-temporal phenomena on surface visualizations. Given its ability to provide enhanced spatial perception and scene maneuverability, virtual reality (VR) catalyzes haptic interactions on surface visualizations. Various interaction modes, encompassing both mid-air and on-surface interactions---with or without the application of assisting force stimuli---have been explored using haptic force feedback devices. In this paper, we evaluate the use of on-surface and assisted on-surface haptic modes of interaction compared to a no-haptic interaction mode. A force-based haptic stylus is used for all three modalities; the on-surface mode uses collision based forces, whereas the assisted on-surface mode is accompanied by an additional snapping force. We conducted a within-subjects user study involving fundamental interaction tasks performed on surface visualizations. Keeping a consistent visual design across all three modes, our study incorporates tasks that require the localization of the highest, lowest, and random points on surfaces; and tasks that focus on brushing curves on surfaces with varying complexity and occlusion levels. Our findings show that participants took almost the same time to brush curves using all the interaction modes. They could draw smoother curves using the on-surface interaction modes compared to the no-haptic mode. However, the assisted on-surface mode provided better accuracy than the on-surface mode. The on-surface mode was slower in point localization, but the accuracy depended on the visual cues and occlusions associated with the tasks. Finally, we discuss participant feedback on using haptic force feedback as a tangible input modality and share takeaways to aid the design of haptics-based tangible interactions for surface visualizations.",Evaluating Force-based Haptics for Immersive Tangible Interactions with Surface Visualizations,,T&E,2024
"Visualization is widely used for exploring personal data, but many visualization authoring systems do not support expressing data in flexible, personal, and organic layouts. Sketching is an accessible tool for experimenting with visualization designs, but formalizing sketched elements into structured data representations is difficult, as modifying hand-drawn glyphs to encode data when available is labour-intensive and error prone. We propose an approach where authors structure their own expressive templates, capturing implicit style as well as explicit data mappings, through sketching a representative visualization for an envisioned or partial dataset. Our approach seeks to support freeform exploration and partial specification, balanced against interactive machine support for specifying the generative procedural rules. We implement this approach in DataGarden, a system designed to support hierarchical data visualizations, and evaluate it with 12 participants in a reproduction study and four experts in a freeform creative task. Participants readily picked up the core idea of template authoring, and the variety of workflows we observed highlight how this process serves design and data ideation as well as visual constraint iteration.

"The increasing reliance on Large Language Models (LLMs) for health information seeking can pose severe risks due to the potential for misinformation and the complexity of these topics. This paper introduces KnowNet, a visualization system that integrates LLMs with Knowledge Graphs (KG) to provide enhanced accuracy and structured exploration. One core idea in KnowNet is to conceptualize the understanding of a subject as the gradual construction of graph visualization, aligning the user's cognitive process with both the structured data in KGs and the unstructured outputs from LLMs. Specifically, we extracted triples (e.g., entities and their relations) from LLM outputs and mapped them into the validated information and supported evidence in external KGs. Based on the neighborhood of the currently explored entities in KGs, KnowNet provides recommendations for further inquiry, aiming to guide a comprehensive understanding without overlooking critical aspects. A progressive graph visualization is proposed to show the alignment between LLMs and KGs, track previous inquiries, and connect this history with current queries and next-step recommendations.

"A wide range of visualization authoring interfaces enable the creation of highly customized visualizations. However, prioritizing expressiveness often impedes the learnability of the authoring interface. The diversity of users, such as varying computational skills and prior experiences in user interfaces, makes it even more challenging for a single authoring interface to satisfy the needs of a broad audience. In this paper, we introduce a framework to balance learnability and expressivity in a visualization authoring system. Adopting insights from learnability studies, such as multimodal interaction and visualization literacy, we explore the design space of blending multiple visualization authoring interfaces for supporting authoring tasks in a complementary and flexible manner. To evaluate the effectiveness of blending interfaces, we implemented a proof-of-concept system, Blace, that combines four common visualization authoring interfaces—template-based, shelf configuration, natural language, and code editor—that are tightly linked to one another to help users easily relate unfamiliar interfaces to more familiar ones. Using the system, we conducted a user study with 12 domain experts who regularly visualize genomics data as part of their analysis workflow. Participants with varied visualization and programming backgrounds were able to successfully reproduce complex visualization examples without a guided tutorial in the study. Feedback from a post-study qualitative questionnaire further suggests that blending interfaces enabled participants to learn the system easily and assisted them in confidently editing unfamiliar visualization grammar in the code editor, enabling expressive customization. Reflecting on our study results and the design of our system, we discuss the different interaction patterns that we identified and design implications for blending visualization authoring interfaces.",Learnable and Expressive Visualization Authoring Through Blended Interfaces,,S&R,2024
"Despite the recent surge of research efforts to make data visualizations accessible to people who are blind or have low-vision (BLV), how to support BLV people's data analysis remains an important and challenging question. As refreshable tactile displays (RTDs) become cheaper and conversational agents continue to improve, their combination provides a promising approach to support BLV people's interactive data analysis. To understand how BLV people would use and react to a system combining an RTD with a conversational agent, we conducted a Wizard-of-Oz study with 11 BLV participants involving line graphs, bar charts, and isarithmic maps. From an analysis of participant interactions, we identified nine distinct patterns and learned that the choice of modalities depended on the type of task and prior experience with tactile graphics. We also found that participants strongly preferred the combination of RTD and speech to a single modality, and that participants with more tactile experience described how tactile images facilitated deeper engagement with the data and supported independent interpretation. Our findings will inform the design of interfaces for such interactive mixed-modality systems.",When Refreshable Tactile Displays Meet Conversational Agents: Investigating Accessible Data Presentation and Analysis with Touch and Speech,,R&I,2024
"We introduce DiffFit, a differentiable algorithm for fitting protein atomistic structures into experimental reconstructed Cryo-Electron Microscopy (cryo-EM) volume map. This process is essential in structural biology to semi-automatically reconstruct large meso-scale models of complex protein assemblies and complete cellular structures that are based on measured cryo-EM  data. Current approaches require manual fitting in 3D that already results in approximately aligned structures followed by an automated fine-tuning of the alignment. With our DiffFit approach, we enable domain scientists to automatically fit new structures and visualize the fitting results for inspection and interactive revision. Our fitting begins with differentiable 3D rigid transformations of the protein atom coordinates, followed by sampling the density values at its atom coordinates from the target cryo-EM volume. To ensure a meaningful correlation between the sampled densities and the protein structure, we propose a novel loss function based on a multi-resolution volume-array approach and the exploitation of the negative space. Such loss function serves as a critical metric for assessing the fitting quality, ensuring both fitting accuracy and improved visualization of the results. We assessed the placement quality of DiffFit with several large, realistic datasets and found its quality to be superior to that of previous methods. We further evaluated our method in two use cases. First, we demonstrate its use in the process of automating the integration of known composite structures into larger protein complexes. Second, we show that it facilitates the fitting of predicted protein domains into volume densities to aid researchers in the identification of unknown proteins. We implemented our algorithm as an open-source plugin (github.com/nanovis/DiffFitViewer) in ChimeraX, a leading visualization software in the field.

"Large Language Models (LLMs) have been successfully adopted for a variety of visualizations tasks, but how far are we from perceptually aware LLMs that can predict human takeaways from visualizations? Graphical perception literature has shown that human chart takeaways are sensitive to visualization design choices, such as the spatial arrangement. In this work, we examine how well LLMs can predict such design choice sensitivity when generating takeaways, using bar charts with varying spatial layouts as a case study. We test four common chart arrangements: vertically juxtaposed, horizontally juxtaposed, overlaid, and stacked, through three experimental phases. In Phase I, we identified the optimal configuration of LLMs to generate meaningful chart takeaways, across three LLM models (GPT3.5, GPT4, GPT4V, and Gemini 1.0 Pro), two temperature settings (0, 0.7), four chart specifications (Vega-Lite, Matplotlib, ggplot2, and scene graphs), and several prompting strategies. We found that even state-of-the-art LLMs can struggle to generate factually accurate takeaways. In Phase 2, using the most optimal LLM configuration, we generated 30 chart takeaways across the four arrangements of bar charts using two datasets, with both zero-shot and one-shot settings. Compared to data on human takeaways from prior work, we found that the takeaways LLMs generate often do not align with human comparisons. In Phase 3, we examined the effect of the charts’ underlying data values on takeaway alignment between humans and LLMs, and found both matches and mismatches. Overall, our work evaluates the ability of LLMs to emulate human interpretations of data and points to challenges and opportunities in using LLMs to predict human-aligned chart takeaways.",How Aligned are Human Chart Takeaways and LLM Predictions?

"Visual validation of regression models in scatterplots is a common practice for assessing model quality, yet its efficacy remains unquantified. We conducted two empirical experiments to investigate individuals' ability to visually validate linear regression models (linear trends) and to examine the impact of common visualization designs on validation quality. The first experiment showed that the level of accuracy for visual estimation of slope (i.e., fitting a line to data) is higher than for visual validation of slope (i.e., accepting a shown line). Notably, we found bias toward slopes that are ''too steep'' in both cases. This lead to novel insights that participants naturally assessed regression with orthogonal distances between the points and the line (i.e., ODR regression) rather than the common vertical distances (OLS regression). In the second experiment, we investigated whether incorporating common designs for regression visualization (error lines, bounding boxes, and confidence intervals) would improve visual validation. Even though error lines reduced validation bias, results failed to show the desired improvements in accuracy for any design. Overall, our findings suggest caution in using visual model validation for linear trends in scatterplots.",Beware of Validation by Eye: Visual Validation of Linear Trends in Scatterplots,,T&E,2024
"Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing high-dimensional data. However, support for interpreting patterns in dimensionality reduction results in the context of the original data space is often insufficient. Consequently, users may struggle to extract insights from the projections. In this paper we introduce DimBridge, a visual analytics tool that allows users to interact with visual patterns in a projection and retrieve corresponding data patterns. DimBridge supports several interactions, allowing users to perform various analyses, from contrasting multiple clusters to explaining complex latent structures. Leveraging first-order predicate logic, DimBridge identifies subspaces in the original dimensions relevant to a queried pattern and provides an interface for users to visualize and interact with them. We demonstrate how DimBridge can help users overcome the challenges associated with interpreting visual patterns in projections.",DimBridge: Interactive Explanation of Visual Patterns in Dimensionality Reductions with Predicate Logic,,DTr,2024
"Effective security patrol management is critical for ensuring safety in diverse environments such as art galleries, airports, and factories. The behavior of patrols in these situations can be modeled by patrolling games. They simulate the behavior of the patrol and adversary in the building, which is modeled as a graph of interconnected nodes representing rooms. The designers of algorithms solving the game face the problem of analyzing complex graph layouts with temporal dependencies. Therefore, appropriate visual support is crucial for them to work effectively. In this paper, we present a novel tool that helps the designers of patrolling games explore the outcomes of the proposed algorithms and approaches, evaluate their success rate, and propose modifications that can improve their solutions. Our tool offers an intuitive and interactive interface, featuring a detailed exploration of patrol routes and probabilities of taking them, simulation of patrols, and other requested features. In close collaboration with experts in designing patrolling games, we conducted three case studies demonstrating the usage and usefulness of our tool. The prototype of the tool, along with exemplary datasets, is available at https://gitlab.fi.muni.cz/formela/strategy-vizualizer.",Who Let the Guards Out: Visual Support for Patrolling Games,,App,2024
"The numerical extraction of vortex cores from time-dependent fluid flow attracted much attention over the past decades. A commonly agreed upon vortex definition remained elusive since a proper vortex core needs to satisfy two hard constraints: it must be objective and Lagrangian. Recent methods on objectivization met the first but not the second constraint, since there was no formal guarantee that the resulting vortex coreline is indeed a pathline of the fluid flow. In this paper, we propose the first vortex core definition that is both objective and Lagrangian. Our approach restricts observer motions to follow along pathlines, which reduces the degrees of freedoms: we only need to optimize for an observer rotation that makes the observed flow as steady as possible. This optimization succeeds along Lagrangian vortex corelines and will result in a non-zero time-partial everywhere else. By performing this optimization at each point of a spatial grid, we obtain a residual scalar field, which we call vortex deviation error. The local minima on the grid serve as seed points for a gradient descent optimization that delivers sub-voxel accurate corelines. The visualization of both 2D and 3D vortex cores is based on the separation of the movement of the vortex core and the swirling flow behavior around it. While the vortex core is represented by a pathline, the swirling motion around it is visualized by streamlines in the correct frame. We demonstrate the utility of the approach on several 2D and 3D time-dependent vector fields.",Objective Lagrangian Vortex Cores and their Visual Representations,,DTr,2024
"The visualization community has a rich history of reflecting upon visualization design flaws. Although research in this area has remained lively, we believe it is essential to continuously revisit this classic and critical topic in visualization research by incorporating more empirical evidence from diverse sources, characterizing new design flaws, building more systematic theoretical frameworks, and understanding the underlying reasons for these flaws. To address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws through the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and categorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur. Specifically, we analyzed 2227 flawed data visualizations collected from an online gallery and derived a design task-associated taxonomy containing 76 specific design flaws. These flaws were further classified into three high-level categories (i.e., misinformation, uninformativeness, unsociability) and ten subcategories (e.g., inaccuracy, unfairness, ambiguity). Next, we organized five focus groups to explore why these design flaws occur and identified seven causes of the flaws. Finally, we proposed a research agenda for combating visualization design flaws and summarize nine research opportunities.",I Came Across a Junk: Understanding Design Flaws of Data Visualization from the Public's Perspective,,R&I,2024
"Assigning discriminable and harmonic colors to samples according to their class labels and spatial distribution can generate attractive visualizations and facilitate data exploration. However, as the number of classes increases, it is challenging to generate a high-quality color assignment result that accommodates all classes simultaneously. A practical solution is to organize classes into a hierarchy and then dynamically assign colors during exploration. However, existing color assignment methods fall short in generating high-quality color assignment results and dynamically aligning them with hierarchical structures. To address this issue, we develop a dynamic color assignment method for hierarchical data, which is formulated as a multi-objective optimization problem. This method simultaneously considers color discriminability, color harmony, and spatial distribution at each hierarchical level. By using the colors of parent classes to guide the color assignment of their child classes, our method further promotes both consistency and clarity across hierarchical levels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating dynamic color assignment results with quantitative experiments and a user study.",Dynamic Color Assignment for Hierarchical Data,,R&I,2024
"In understanding and redesigning the function of proteins in modern biochemistry, protein engineers are increasingly focusing on exploring regions in proteins called loops. Analyzing various characteristics of these regions helps the experts design the transfer of the desired function from one protein to another. This process is denoted as loop grafting. We designed a set of interactive visualizations that provide experts with visual support through all the loop grafting pipeline steps. The workflow is divided into several phases, reflecting the steps of the pipeline. Each phase is supported by a specific set of abstracted 2D visual representations of proteins and their loops that are interactively linked with the 3D View of proteins. By sequentially passing through the individual phases, the user shapes the list of loops that are potential candidates for loop grafting. Finally, the actual in-silico insertion of the loop candidates from one protein to the other is performed, and the results are visually presented to the user. In this way, the fully computational rational design of proteins and their loops results in newly designed protein structures that can be further assembled and tested through in-vitro experiments. We showcase the contribution of our visual support design on a real case scenario changing the enantiomer selectivity of the engineered enzyme. Moreover, we provide the readers with the experts' feedback.",Visual Support for the Loop Grafting Workflow on Proteins,,App,2024
"Existing deep learning-based surrogate models facilitate efficient data generation, but fall short in uncertainty quantification, efficient parameter space exploration, and reverse prediction. In our work, we introduce SurroFlow, a novel normalizing flow-based surrogate model, to learn the invertible transformation between simulation parameters and simulation outputs. The model not only allows accurate predictions of simulation outcomes for a given simulation parameter but also supports uncertainty quantification in the data generation process. Additionally, it enables efficient simulation parameter recommendation and exploration. We integrate SurroFlow and a genetic algorithm as the backend of a visual interface to support effective user-guided ensemble simulation exploration and visualization.

"Multi-modal embeddings form the foundation for vision-language models, such as CLIP embeddings, the most widely used text-image embeddings. However, these embeddings are hard to interpret and vulnerable to subtle misalignment of cross-modal features, resulting in decreased model performance and diminished generalization. To address this problem, we design ModalChorus, an interactive system for visual probing and alignment of multi-modal embeddings. ModalChorus primarily offers a two-stage process: 1) embedding probing with Modal Fusion Map (MFM), a novel parametric dimensionality reduction method that integrates both metric and nonmetric objectives to enhance modality fusion; and 2) embedding alignment that allows users to interactively articulate intentions for both point-set and set-set alignments. Quantitative and qualitative comparisons for CLIP embeddings with existing dimensionality reduction (e.g., t-SNE and MDS) and data fusion (e.g., data context map) methods demonstrate the advantages of MFM in showcasing cross-modal features over common vision-language datasets. Case studies reveal that ModalChorus can facilitate intuitive discovery of misalignment and efficient re-alignment in scenarios ranging from zero-shot classification to cross-modal retrieval and generation.",ModalChorus: Visual Probing and Alignment of Multi-modal Embeddings via Modal Fusion Map,,App,2024
"With the increase of graph size, it becomes difficult or even impossible to visualize graph structures clearly within the limited screen space. Consequently, it is crucial to design effective visual representations for large graphs. In this paper, we propose AdaMotif, a novel approach that can capture the essential structure patterns of large graphs and effectively reveal the overall structures via adaptive motif designs. Specifically, our approach involves partitioning a given large graph into multiple subgraphs, then clustering similar subgraphs and extracting similar structural information within each cluster. Subsequently, adaptive motifs representing each cluster are generated and utilized to replace the corresponding subgraphs, leading to a simplified visualization. Our approach aims to preserve as much information from the subgraphs as possible, effectively simplifying graphs while minimizing information loss. Notably, our approach successfully visualizes crucial community information within a large graph. We conduct case studies and a user study using both synthetic and real-world graphs to validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach. The results demonstrate the capability of our approach in simplifying graphs while retaining important structural and community information.",AdaMotif: Graph Simplification via Adaptive Motif Design,,R&I,2024
"Partitionings (or segmentations) divide a given domain into disjoint connected regions whose union forms again the entire domain. Multi-dimensional partitionings occur, for example, when analyzing parameter spaces of simulation models, where each segment of the partitioning represents a region of similar model behavior. Having computed a partitioning, one is commonly interested in understanding how large the segments are and which segments lie next to each other. While visual representations of 2D domain partitionings that reveal sizes and neighborhoods are straightforward, this is no longer the case when considering multi-dimensional domains of three or more dimensions. We propose an algorithm for computing 2D embeddings of multi-dimensional partitionings. The embedding shall have the following properties: It shall maintain the topology of the partitioning and optimize the area sizes and joint boundary lengths of the embedded segments to match the respective sizes and lengths in the multi-dimensional domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to different use cases, including the visual exploration of 3D spatial domain segmentations and multi-dimensional parameter space partitionings of simulation ensembles.  We numerically evaluate our algorithm with respect to how well sizes and lengths are preserved depending on the dimensionality of the domain and the number of segments.",2D Embeddings of Multi-dimensional Partitionings,,DTr,2024
"We present a path-based design model and system for designing and creating visualisations. Our model represents a systematic approach to constructing visual representations of data or concepts following a predefined sequence of steps. The initial step involves outlining the overall appearance of the visualisation by creating a skeleton structure, referred to as a flowpath. Subsequently, we specify objects, visual marks, properties, and appearance, storing them in a gene. Lastly, we map data onto the flowpath, ensuring suitable morphisms. Alternative designs are created by exchanging values in the gene. For example, designs that share similar traits, are created by making small incremental changes to the gene. Our design method develops a wide variety of creative ideas, space-filling visualisations, and traditional designs (bar chart, pie chart etc.) Our implementation, demonstrates the model, and we apply the output visualisations onto a smart-watch and on visualisation dashboards. In this article we (1) introduce, define and explain the path model and discuss possibilities for its use, (2) present our implementation, results, and evaluation, and (3) demonstrate and evaluate an application of its use on a mobile watch.",Path-based Design Model for Constructing and Exploring Alternative Visualisations,,S&R,2024
"We present Cell2Cell, a novel visual analytics approach for quantifying and visualizing networks of cell-cell interactions in three-dimensional (3D) multi-channel cancerous tissue data. By analyzing cellular interactions, biomedical domain experts can gain a more accurate understanding of the intricate relationships between cancer and immune cells. Recent methods have focused on inferring interaction based on the proximity of cells in low-resolution 2D multi-channel imaging data. By contrast, we analyze cell interactions by quantifying the intensities of protein expressions extracted from high-resolution 3D multi-channel volume data. Such analyses have a strong exploratory nature and require a tight integration of domain experts in the analysis loop to leverage their deep knowledge. We propose two complementary semi-automated approaches to cope with the increasing size and complexity of the data in an interactive fashion: On the one hand, we interpret cell-to-cell interactions as edges in a cell graph and analyze the image signal (protein expressions) along those edges, using spatial as well as abstract data visualizations. Complementary, we propose a cell-centered approach, enabling scientists to visually analyze polarized distributions of proteins in three dimensions, which also captures neighboring cells with biochemical and cell biological consequences. We evaluate our application in two case studies, where computational biologists and medical experts use \tool to investigate tumor micro-environments to identify and quantify T-cell activation in human tissue data. We confirmed that our tool can fully solve both use cases and enables a streamlined and detailed analysis of cell-cell interactions.",Cell2Cell: Explorative Cell Interaction Analysis in Multi-Volumetric Tissue Data,,App,2024
"We propose and study a novel cross-reality environment that seamlessly integrates a monoscopic 2D surface (an interactive screen with touch and pen input) with a stereoscopic 3D space (an augmented reality HMD) to jointly host spatial data visualizations. This innovative approach combines the best of two conventional methods of displaying and manipulating spatial 3D data, enabling users to fluidly explore diverse visual forms using tailored interaction techniques. Providing such effective 3D data exploration techniques is pivotal for conveying its intricate spatial structures---often at multiple spatial or semantic scales---across various application domains and requiring diverse visual representations for effective visualization. To understand user reactions to our new environment, we began with an elicitation user study, in which we captured their responses and interactions. We observed that users adapted their interaction approaches based on perceived visual representations, with natural transitions in spatial awareness and actions while navigating across the physical surface. Our findings then informed the development of a design space for spatial data exploration in cross-reality. We thus developed cross-reality environments tailored to three distinct domains: for 3D molecular structure data, for 3D point cloud data, and for 3D anatomical data. In particular, we designed interaction techniques that account for the inherent features of interactions in both spaces, facilitating various forms of interaction including mid-air gestures, touch interactions, pen interactions, and combinations thereof to enhance the users' sense of presence and engagement. We assessed the usability of our environment with biologists, focusing on its use for domain research. In addition, we evaluated our interaction transition designs with virtual and mixed-reality experts to gather further insights. As a result, we provide our design suggestions for the cross-reality environment, emphasizing the interaction with diverse visual representations and seamless interaction transitions between 2D and 3D spaces.",SpatialTouch: Exploring Spatial Data Visualizations in Cross-reality,,S&R,2024
"High-dimensional data, characterized by many features, can be difficult to visualize effectively. Dimensionality reduction techniques, such as PCA, UMAP, and t-SNE, address this challenge by projecting the data into a lower-dimensional space while preserving important relationships. TopoMap is another technique that excels at preserving the underlying structure of the data, leading to interpretable visualizations. In particular, TopoMap maps the high-dimensional data into a visual space, guaranteeing that the 0-dimensional persistence diagram of the Rips filtration of the visual space matches the one from the high-dimensional data. However, the original Topomap algorithm can be slow and its layout can be too sparse for large and complex datasets. In this paper, we propose three improvements to TopoMap: 1) a more space-efficient layout, 2) a significantly faster implementation, and 3) a novel treemap-based representation to aid the exploration of the projections. These advancements make TopoMap, now referred to as TopoMap++, a more powerful tool for visualizing high-dimensional data, similar to how t-SNE surpassed SNE in popularity.",TopoMap++: A faster and more space efficient technique to compute projections with topological guarantees,,DTr,2024
"Probability density function (PDF) curves are among the few charts on a Cartesian coordinate system that are commonly presented without y-axes. This design decision may be due to the lack of relevance of vertical scaling in normal PDFs. In fact, as long as two normal PDFs have the same mean and standard deviations (SDs), they can be scaled to occupy different amounts of vertical space while still remaining statistically identical. Because unscaled PDF height increases as SD decreases, visualization designers may find themselves tempted to vertically shrink low-SD PDFs to avoid occlusion or save white space in their figures. While irregular vertical scaling has been explored in bar and line charts, the visualization community has yet to investigate how this purely visual manipulation may affect reader comparisons of PDFs. In this paper, we present two preregistered quantitative experiments (n=600, n=401) that systematically demonstrate that vertical scaling can lead to misinterpretations of PDFs. We also test visual interventions to mitigate misinterpretation. In some contexts, we find that including a y-axis reduces this effect. Overall, we find that keeping vertical scaling consistent, and therefore maintaining equal pixel areas under PDF curves, results in the highest likelihood of accurate comparisons. Our findings provide the first insights into the impact of vertical scaling on PDFs, and reveal the complicated nature of proportional area comparisons.",The Impact of Vertical Scaling on Normal Probability Density Function Plots,,R&I,2024
"Despite the development of numerous visual analytics tools for event sequence data across various domains, including, but not limited to healthcare, digital marketing, and user behavior analysis, comparing these domain-specific investigations and transferring the results to new datasets and problem areas remain challenging. Task abstractions can help us go beyond domain-specific details, but existing visualization task abstractions are insufficient for event sequence visual analytics because they primarily focus on tabular datasets and often overlook automated analytical techniques. To address this gap, we propose a domain-agnostic multi-level task framework for event sequence analysis, derived from an analysis of 58 papers that present event sequence visualization systems. Our framework consists of four levels: objective, intent, strategy, and technique. Overall objectives identify the main goals of analysis. Intents comprises five high-level approaches adopted at each analysis step: augment data, simplify data, configure data, configure visualization, and create provenance. Each intent is accomplished through a number of strategies, for instance, data simplification can be achieved through aggregation, summarization, or segmentation. Finally, each strategy can be implemented by a set of techniques depending on the input and output components. We further show that techniques can be expressed through a quartet of action-input-output-criteria. We demonstrate the framework’s power through mapping case studies and discuss its similarities and differences with previous event sequence task taxonomies.",A Multi-Level Task Framework for Event Sequence Analysis,,T&E,2024
"In recent years, the global adoption of electric vehicles (EVs) has surged, prompting a corresponding rise in the installation of charging stations. This proliferation has underscored the importance of expediting the deployment of charging infrastructure. Both academia and industry have thus devoted to addressing the charging station location problem (CSLP) to streamline this process. However, prevailing algorithms addressing CSLP are hampered by restrictive assumptions and computational overhead, leading to a dearth of comprehensive evaluations in the spatiotemporal dimensions. Consequently, their practical viability is restricted. Moreover, the placement of charging stations exerts a significant impact on both the road network and the power grid, which necessitates the evaluation of the potential post-deployment impacts on these interconnected networks holistically. In this study, we propose CSLens, a visual analytics system designed to inform charging station deployment decisions through the lens of coupled transportation and power networks. CSLens offers multiple visualizations and interactive features, empowering users to delve into the existing charging station layout, explore alternative deployment solutions, and assess the ensuring impact. To validate the efficacy of CSLens, we conducted two case studies and engaged in interviews with domain experts. Through these efforts, we substantiated the usability and practical utility of CSLens in enhancing the decision-making process surrounding charging station deployment. Our findings underscore CSLens’s potential to serve as a valuable asset in navigating the complexities of charging infrastructure planning.",CSLens: Towards Better Deploying Charging Stations via Visual Analytics —— A Coupled Networks Perspective,,App,2024
"We introduce a visual analysis method for multiple causality graphs with different outcome variables, namely, multi-outcome causality graphs. Multi-outcome causality graphs are important in healthcare for understanding multimorbidity and comorbidity. To support the visual analysis, we collaborated with medical experts to devise two comparative visualization techniques at different stages of the analysis process. First, a progressive visualization method is proposed for comparing multiple state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms. The method can handle mixed-type datasets comprising both continuous and categorical variables and assist in the creation of a fine-tuned causality graph of a single outcome. Second, a comparative graph layout technique and specialized visual encodings are devised for the quick comparison of multiple causality graphs. In our visual analysis approach, analysts start by building individual causality graphs for each outcome variable, and then, multi-outcome causality graphs are generated and visualized with our comparative technique for analyzing differences and commonalities of these causality graphs. Evaluation includes quantitative measurements on benchmark datasets, a case study with a medical expert, and expert user studies with real-world health research data.",Visual Analysis of Multi-outcome Causal Graphs,,A&D,2024
"Room-scale immersive data visualisations provide viewers a wide-scale overview of a large dataset, but to interact precisely with individual data points they typically have to navigate to change their point of view.  In traditional screen-based visualisations, focus-and-context techniques allow visualisation users to keep a full dataset in view while making detailed selections.  Such techniques have been studied extensively on desktop to allow precise selection within large data sets, but they have not been explored in immersive 3D modalities. In this paper we develop a novel immersive focus-and-context technique based on a ``magic portal'' metaphor adapted specifically for data visualisation scenarios.  An extendable-hand interaction technique is used to place a portal close to the region of interest.  The other end of the portal then opens comfortably within the user's physical reach such that they can reach through to precisely select individual data points.  Through a controlled study with 24 participants, we find strong evidence that portals reduce overshoots in selection and overall hand trajectory length, reducing arm fatigue compared to ranged interaction without the portal.  The portals also enable us to use a robot arm to provide haptic feedback for data within the limited volume of the portal region. We demonstrate applications for portal-based selection through two use-case scenarios.",Precise Embodied Data Selection in Room-scale Visualisations While Retaining View Context,,App,2024
"Contour trees describe the topology of level sets in scalar fields and are widely used in topological data analysis and visualization. A main challenge for utilizing contour trees for large-scale scientific data is their computation at scale using high-performance computing. To address this challenge, recent work has introduced distributed hierarchical contour trees for distributed computation and storage of contour trees. However, effective use of these distributed structures in analysis and visualization requires subsequent computation of geometric properties and branch decomposition to support contour extraction and exploration. In this work, we introduce distributed algorithms for augmentation, hypersweeps, and branch decomposition that enable parallel computation of geometric properties, and support the use of distributed contour trees as a query structure for scientific exploration. We evaluate the parallel performance of these algorithms and apply them to identify and extract important contours for scientific visualization.","Distributed Augmentation, Hypersweeps, and Branch Decomposition of Contour Trees for Scientific Exploration",,DTr,2024
"The widespread use of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has recently resulted in their application to challenging scientific visualization tasks. While advanced DNNs demonstrate impressive generalization abilities, understanding factors like prediction quality, confidence, robustness, and uncertainty is crucial.

In this work, we develop uncertainty-aware implicit neural representations to model steady-state vector fields effectively. We comprehensively evaluate the efficacy of two principled deep uncertainty estimation techniques: (1) Deep Ensemble and (2) Monte Carlo Dropout, aimed at enabling uncertainty-informed visual analysis of features within steady vector field data.

"User experience in data visualization is typically assessed through post-viewing self-reports, but these overlook the dynamic cognitive processes during interaction. This study explores the use of mind wandering as a dynamic measure during visualization exploration. Participants reported mind wandering while viewing visualizations from a pre-labeled visualization database and then provided quantitative ratings of trust, engagement, and design quality, along with qualitative descriptions and short-term/long-term recall assessments. Results show that mind wandering negatively affects short-term visualization recall and various post-viewing measures, particularly for visualizations with little text annotation. Further, the type of mind wandering impacts engagement and emotional response. Mind wandering also acts as a serial mediator between visualization design elements and post-viewing measures.  Overall, this research underscores the importance of incorporating mind wandering as a dynamic measure in visualization design and evaluation, offering novel avenues for enhancing user engagement and comprehension.","Mind Drifts, Data Shifts: Utilizing Mind Wandering to Track the Evolution of User Experience with Data Visualizations",,R&I,2024
"Understanding the input and output of data wrangling scripts is crucial for various tasks like debugging codes and onboarding new data. However, existing research on script understanding primarily focuses on revealing the process of data transformations, lacking the ability to analyze the potential scope, i.e., the space of script inputs and outputs. Meanwhile, constructing input/output space during script analysis is challenging, as the wrangling scripts could be semantically complex and diverse, and the association between different data objects is intricate. To facilitate data workers in understanding the input and output spaces of wrangling scripts, we summarize ten types of constraints to express table spaces, and build a mapping between data transformations and these constraints to guide the construction of the input/output for individual transformations. Then, we propose a constraint generation model for integrating table constraints across multiple transformations. Based on the model, we develop Ferry, an interactive system that extracts and visualizes the data constraints describing the input and output spaces of data wrangling scripts, thereby enabling users to grasp the high-level semantics of complex scripts and locate the origins of faulty data transformations. Besides, Ferry provides example input and output data to assist users in interpreting the extracted constraints, checking and resolving the conflicts between these constraints and any uploaded dataset. Ferry's effectiveness and usability are evaluated via a usage scenario and two case studies: the first assists users in onboarding new data and debugging scripts, while the second verifies input-output compatibility across data processing modules. Furthermore, an illustrative application is presented to demonstrate Ferry's flexibility.",Ferry: Toward Better Understanding of Input/Output Space for Data Wrangling Scripts,,DTr,2024
"As a step towards improving visualization literacy, we investigated how students approach reading visualizations differently after taking a university-level visualization course. We asked students to verbally walk through their process of making sense of unfamiliar visualizations, and conducted a qualitative analysis of these walkthroughs.   Our qualitative analysis found changes in students' walkthroughs consistent with explicit learning goals of visualization courses. After taking a visualization course, students also engaged with visualizations in more sophisticated ways not fully captured by explicit learning goals: they were more likely to exhibit design empathy by thinking critically about the tradeoffs behind why a chart was designed in a particular way, and were better able to deconstruct a chart to make sense of it. We also gave students a quantitative assessment of visualization literacy and found no evidence of scores improving after the class,  likely because the test we used focused on a different set of skills than those emphasized in visualization classes. While current measurement instruments for visualization literacy are useful, we propose developing standardized assessments for additional aspects of visualization literacy, such as deconstruction and design empathy. We also suggest those additional aspects could be made more explicit in learning goals set by visualization educators.

"Hypergraphs provide a natural way to represent polyadic relationships in network data. For large hypergraphs, it is often difficult to visually detect structures within the data. Recently, a scalable polygon-based visualization framework was developed allowing hypergraphs with thousands of hyperedges to be simplified and examined at different levels of detail. However, this approach does not consider structures such as cycles, bridges, and branches. Consequently, structures can be lost at simplified scales, making interpretations for real-world applications unreliable. In this paper, we define hypergraph structures using the bipartite graph representation. Powered by our analysis, we provide an algorithm to decompose large hypergraphs into meaningful features and to identify regions of non-planarity. We also introduce a set of topology preserving and topology altering atomic operations, enabling the preservation of important structures while removing topological noise in simplified scales. We demonstrate our approach in several real-world applications.",Structure-Aware Simplification for Hypergraph Visualization,,R&I,2024
"The semantic similarity between documents of a text corpus can be visualized using map-like metaphors based on two-dimensional scatterplot layouts. These layouts result from a dimensionality reduction on the document-term matrix or a representation within a latent embedding, including topic models. Thereby, the resulting layout depends on the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction and is therefore affected by changes in them. Furthermore, the resulting layout is affected by changes in the input data and hyperparameters of the dimensionality reduction. However, such changes to the layout require additional cognitive efforts from the user. In this work, we present a sensitivity study that analyzes the stability of these layouts concerning (1) changes in the text corpora, (2) changes in the hyperparameter, and (3) randomness in the initialization. Our approach has two stages: data measurement and data analysis. First, we derived layouts for the combination of three text corpora and six text embeddings and a grid-search-inspired hyperparameter selection of the dimensionality reductions. Afterward, we quantified the similarity of the layouts through ten metrics, concerning local and global structures and class separation. Second, we analyzed the resulting 42817 tabular data points in a descriptive statistical analysis. From this, we derived guidelines for informed decisions on the layout algorithm and highlight specific hyperparameter settings.

"This research explores a novel paradigm for preserving topological segmentations in existing error-bounded lossy compressors. Today's lossy compressors rarely consider preserving topologies such as Morse-Smale complexes, and the discrepancies in topology between original and decompressed datasets could potentially result in erroneous interpretations or even incorrect scientific conclusions. In this paper, we focus on preserving Morse-Smale segmentations in 2D/3D piecewise linear scalar fields, targeting the precise reconstruction of minimum/maximum labels induced by the integral curve of each vertex. The key is to derive a series of edits during compression time; the edits are applied to the decompressed data, leading to an accurate reconstruction of segmentations while keeping the error within the prescribed error bound. To this end, we developed a workflow to fix extrema and integral curves alternatively until convergence within finite iterations; we accelerate each workflow component with shared-memory/GPU parallelism to make the performance practical for coupling with compressors. We demonstrate use cases with fluid dynamics, ocean, and cosmology application datasets with a 1000x acceleration with an NVIDIA A100 GPU.",MSz: An Efficient Parallel Algorithm for Correcting Morse-Smale Segmentations in Error-Bounded Lossy Compressors,,DTr,2024
"In the biomedical domain, visualizing the document embeddings of an extensive corpus has been widely used in information-seeking tasks. However, three key challenges with existing visualizations make it difficult for clinicians to find information efficiently. First, the document embeddings used in these visualizations are generated statically by pretrained language models, which cannot adapt to the user's evolving interest.  Second, existing document visualization techniques cannot effectively display how the documents are relevant to users’ interest, making it difficult for users to identify the most pertinent information. Third, existing embedding generation and visualization processes suffer from a lack of interpretability, making it difficult to understand, trust and use the result for decision-making. In this paper, we present a novel visual analytics pipeline for user-driven document representation and iterative information seeking (VADIS). VADIS introduces a prompt-based attention model (PAM) that generates dynamic document embedding and document relevance adjusted to the user's query. To effectively visualize these two pieces of information, we design a new document map that leverages a circular grid layout to display documents based on both their relevance to the query and the semantic similarity. Additionally, to improve the interpretability, we introduce a corpus-level attention visualization method to improve the user's understanding of the model focus and to enable the users to identify potential oversight. This visualization, in turn, empowers users to refine, update and introduce new queries, thereby facilitating a dynamic and iterative information-seeking experience. We evaluated VADIS quantitatively and qualitatively on a real-world dataset of biomedical research papers to demonstrate its effectiveness.",VADIS: A Visual Analytics Pipeline for Dynamic Document Representation and Information Seeking,,A&D,2024
"Scalar field comparison is a fundamental task in scientific visualization. In topological data analysis, we compare topological descriptors of scalar fields---such as persistence diagrams and merge trees---as they provide succinct and robust abstract representations. While several similarity measures for topological descriptors seem to be both asymptotically and practically efficient with polynomial time algorithms, they do not scale well when handling large-scale, time-varying scientific data and ensembles. In this paper, we propose a new framework to facilitate the comparative analysis of merge trees, inspired by tools from locality sensitive hashing (LSH). LSH hashes similar objects into the same hash buckets with high probability. We propose two new similarity measures for merge trees that can be computed via LSH, using new extensions to Recursive MinHash and subpath signature, respectively. Our similarity measures are extremely efficient to compute and closely resemble the results of existing measures such as merge tree edit distance or geometric interleaving distance. Our experiments demonstrate the utility of our LSH framework in applications such as shape matching, clustering, key event detection, and ensemble summarization.",Fast Comparative Analysis of Merge Trees Using Locality-Sensitive Hashing,,DTr,2024
"he optimization of cooling systems is important in many cases, for example for cabin and battery cooling in electric cars. Such an optimization is governed by multiple, conflicting objectives and it is performed across a multi-dimensional parameter space. The extent of the parameter space, the complexity of the non-linear model of the system, as well as the time needed per simulation run and factors that are not modeled in the simulation necessitate an iterative, semi-automatic approach. We present an interactive visual optimization approach, where the user works with a p-h diagram to steer an iterative, guided optimization process. A deep learning (DL) model provides estimates for parameters, given a target characterization of the system, while numerical simulation is used to predict system characteristics for an ensemble of parameter sets. Since the DL model only serves as an approximation of the inverse of the cooling system and since target characteristics can be chosen according to different, competing objectives, an iterative optimization process is realized, developing multiple sets of intermediate solutions, which are visually related to each other. The standard p-h diagram, integrated interactively in this approach, is complemented by a dual, also interactive visual representation of additional expressive measures representing the system characteristics. We show how the known four-points semantic of the p-h diagram meaningfully transfers to the dual data representation. When evaluating this approach with our partners in the automotive domain, we found that our solution helped with the overall comprehension of the cooling system and that it lead to a faster convergence during optimization.",Interactive Design-of-Experiments: Optimizing a Cooling System,,App,2024
"Visualizing relational data is crucial for understanding complex connections between entities in social networks, political affiliations, or biological interactions. Well-known representations like node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices offer valuable insights, but their effectiveness relies on the ability to identify patterns in the underlying topological structure. Reordering strategies and layout algorithms play a vital role in the visualization process since the arrangement of nodes, edges, or cells influences the visibility of these patterns. The BioFabric visualization combines elements of node-link diagrams and adjacency matrices, leveraging the strengths of both, the visual clarity of node-link diagrams and the tabular organization of adjacency matrices. A unique characteristic of BioFabric is the possibility to reorder nodes and edges separately. This raises the question of which combination of layout algorithms best reveals certain patterns.  In this paper, we discuss patterns and anti-patterns in BioFabric, such as staircases or escalators, relate them to already established patterns, and propose metrics to evaluate their quality. Based on these quality metrics, we compared combinations of well-established reordering techniques applied to BioFabric with a well-known benchmark data set. Our experiments indicate that the edge order has a stronger influence on revealing patterns than the node layout. The results show that the best combination for revealing staircases is a barycentric node layout, together with an edge order based on node indices and length. Our research contributes a first building block for many promising future research directions, which we also share and discuss.

"Classical bibliography, by scrutinizing preserved catalogs from both official archives and personal collections of accumulated books, examines the books throughout history, thereby elucidating cultural development across historical periods. In this work, we collaborate with domain experts to accomplish the task of data annotation concerning Chinese ancient catalogs. We introduce the CataAnno system that facilitates users in completing annotations more efficiently through cross-linked views, recommendation methods and convenient annotation interactions. The recommendation method can learn the background knowledge and annotation patterns that experts subconsciously integrate into the data during prior annotation processes. CataAnno searches for the most relevant examples previously annotated and recommends to the user. Meanwhile, the cross-linked views assist users in comprehending the correlations between entries and offer explanations for these recommendations. Evaluation and expert feedback confirm that the CataAnno system, by offering high-quality recommendations and visualizing the relationships between entries, can mitigate the necessity for specialized knowledge during the annotation process. This results in enhanced accuracy and consistency in annotations, thereby enhancing the overall efficiency",CataAnno: An Ancient Catalog Annotator for Annotation Cleaning by Recommendation,,App,2024
"Over the past decade, several urban visual analytics systems have been proposed to tackle a host of challenges faced by cities, in areas as diverse as transportation, weather, and real estate. Many of these systems have been designed through engagement with urban experts, aiming to distill intricate urban analysis workflows into interactive visualizations and interfaces. The design, implementation, and practical use of these systems, however, still rely on siloed approaches that lead to bespoke tools that are hard to reproduce and extend. At the design level, these systems undervalue rich data workflows from urban experts by usually only treating them as data providers and evaluators. At the implementation level, these systems lack interoperability with other technical frameworks. At the practical use level, these systems tend to be narrowly focused on specific fields, inadvertently creating barriers for cross-domain collaboration. To tackle these gaps, we present Curio, a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics. Curio uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine preprocessing, managing, and visualization stages while tracking provenance of code and visualizations. In collaboration with urban experts, we evaluate Curio through a diverse series of use cases targeting urban accessibility, urban microclimate, and sunlight access. These cases use different types of urban data and domain methodologies to illustrate Curio's flexibility in tackling pressing societal challenges.",Curio: A Dataflow-Based Framework for Collaborative Urban Visual Analytics,,S&R,2024
"When using exploratory visual analysis to examine multivariate hierarchical data, users often need to query data to narrow down the scope of analysis. However, formulating effective query expressions remains a challenge for multivariate hierarchical data, particularly when datasets become very large. To address this issue, we develop a declarative grammar,  HiRegEx (Hierarchical data Regular Expression), for querying and exploring multivariate hierarchical data. Rooted in the extended multi-level task topology framework for tree visualizations (e-MLTT), HiRegEx delineates three query targets (node, path, and subtree) and two aspects for querying these targets (features and positions), and uses operators developed based on classical regular expressions for query construction. We develop a prototype system, TreeQueryER, to integrate an exploratory framework for querying and exploring multivariate hierarchical data based on HiRegEx. The exploratory framework includes three major components: top-down pattern specification, bottom-up data-driven inquiry, and context-creation data overview. We validate the expressiveness of HiRegEx with the tasks from the e-MLTT framework and showcase its utility and effectiveness through a usage scenario involving expert users in the analysis of a citation tree dataset.",HiRegEx: Interactive Visual Query and Exploration of Multivariate Hierarchical Data,,S&R,2024
"The concept of an intelligent augmented reality (AR) assistant has applications as significant as they are wide-ranging, with potential uses in medicine, military endeavors, and mechanics. Such an assistant must be able to perceive the performer’s environment and actions, reason about the state of the environment in relation to a given task, and seamlessly interact with the performer. These interactions typically involve an AR headset equipped with a variety of sensors which capture video, audio, and haptic feedback. Previous works have sought to facilitate the development of such an assistant by visualizing these sensor data streams as well as the machine learning model outputs that support an assistant’s perception and reasoning capabilities. However, existing visual analytics systems do not include biometric data or focus on user modeling, and are only capable of visualizing a single task session for a single performer at a time. Furthermore, they mainly focus on traditional task analysis that typically assumes a linear progression from one step to the next. We propose a visual analytics system that allows users to compare performance during multiple task sessions focusing on non-linear tasks where different paths or sequences can lead to the successful completion of the task. In particular, we design visualizations for understanding user behavior through functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data as a proxy for perception, attention, and memory as well as corresponding motion data (acceleration, angular velocity, and eye gaze). We distill these insights into visual embeddings that allow users to easily select groups of sessions with similar behaviors. We provide case studies that explore how insights into task performance can be gleaned from these visualizations using data collected during helicopter copilot training tasks. Finally, we evaluate our approach by conducting an in-depth examination of a think-aloud experiment with five domain experts.",HuBar: A Visual Analytics Tool to Explore Human Behaviour based on fNIRS in AR guidance systems,,App,2024
"Shape is commonly used to distinguish between categories in multi-class scatterplots. However, existing guidelines for choosing effective shape palettes rely largely on intuition and do not consider how these needs may change as the number of categories increases. Although shapes can be a finite number compared to colors, they can not be represented by a numerical space, making it difficult to propose a general guideline for shape choices or shed light on the design heuristics of designer-crafted shape palettes. This paper presents a series of four experiments evaluating the efficiency of 39 shapes across three tasks -- relative mean judgment tasks, expert choices, and data correlation estimation. Given how complex and tangled results are, rather than relying on conventional features for modeling, we built a model and introduced a corresponding design tool that offers recommendations for shape encodings. The perceptual effectiveness of shapes significantly varies across specific pairs, and certain shapes may enhance perceptual efficiency and accuracy. However, how performance varies does not map well to classical features of shape such as angles, fill, or convex hull. We developed a model based on pairwise relations between shapes measured in our experiments and the number of shapes required to intelligently recommend shape palettes for a given design. This tool provides designers with agency over shape selection while incorporating empirical elements of perceptual performance captured in our study. Our model advances the understanding of shape perception in visualization contexts and provides practical design guidelines for advanced shape usage in visualization design that optimize perceptual efficiency.",An Empirically Grounded Approach for Designing Shape Palettes,,T&E,2024
"In medical diagnostics of both early disease detection and routine patient care, particle-based contamination of in-vitro diagnostics (IVD) consumables poses a significant threat to patients. Objective data-driven decision making on the severity of contamination is key for reducing risk to patients, while saving time and cost in the quality assessment process. Our collaborators introduced us to their quality control process, including particle data acquisition through image recognition, feature extraction, and attributes reflecting the production context of particles. Shortcomings of the current process are analysis problems, like weak support in exploring thousands of particle images, associated attributes, and ineffective knowledge externalization for sense-making. Following the design study methodology, our contributions are a characterization of the problem space and requirements, the development and validation of DaedalusData, a comprehensive discussion of our study’s learnings, and a generalizable approach for knowledge externalization. DaedalusData is a visual analytics system that empowers domain experts to explore particle contamination patterns, to label particles in label alphabets, and to externalize knowledge through semi-supervised label-informed data projections. The results of our case study show that DaedalusData supports experts in generating meaningful, comprehensive data overviews. Additionally, our user study evaluation shows high usability of DaedalusData and efficiently supports the labeling of large quantities of particles, and utilizes externalized knowledge to augment the dataset. Reflecting on our approach, we discuss insights on dataset augmentation via human knowledge externalization, and on the scalabilty and trade-offs that come with the adoption of this approach in practice.","DaedalusData: Exploration, Knowledge Externalization and Labeling of Particles in Medical Manufacturing - A Design Study",,App,2024
"Feature grid Scene Representation Networks (SRNs) have been applied to scientific data as compact functional surrogates for analysis and visualization. As SRNs are black-box lossy data representations, assessing the prediction quality is critical for scientific visualization applications to ensure that scientists can trust the information being visualized.  Currently, existing architectures do not support inference time reconstruction quality assessment, as voxel-wise errors cannot be evaluated in the absence of ground truth data. By employing uncertain neural network architectures in feature grid SRNs, we obtain prediction variances during inference time to facilitate confidence-aware data reconstruction. Specifically, we propose a parameter-efficient multi-decoder Ensemble SRN (E-SRN) architecture consisting of a shared feature grid with multiple lightweight multi-layer perceptron decoders. E-SRN can generate a set of plausible predictions for a given input coordinate to compute the mean as the ensemble prediction and the variance as a confidence score. The voxel-wise variance can be rendered along with the data to inform the reconstruction quality, or be integrated into uncertainty-aware volume visualization algorithms. To prevent the misalignment between the quantified variance and the prediction quality, we propose a novel variance regularization loss for ensemble learning that promotes the Regularized Ensemble SRN (RE-SRN) to obtain a more reliable variance that correlates closely to the true model error. We comprehensively evaluate the quality of variance quantification and data reconstruction of Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD), Mean Field Variational Inference (MFVI), Deep Ensemble (DE), and Predicting Variance (PV) in comparison with our proposed E-SRN and RE-SRN applied to state-of-the-art feature grid SRNs across diverse scalar field datasets. We demonstrate that RE-SRN attains the most accurate data reconstruction and competitive variance-error correlation among uncertain SRNs under the same neural network parameter budgets. Furthermore, we present an adaptation of uncertainty-aware volume rendering and shed light on the potential of incorporating uncertain predictions in improving the quality of volume rendering for uncertain SRNs. Through ablation studies on the regularization strength and ensemble size, we show that E-SRN and RE-SRN are expected to perform sufficiently well with a default configuration without requiring customized hyperparameter settings for different datasets.",Regularized Multi-Decoder Ensemble for an Error-Aware Scene Representation Network,,DTr,2024
"A layered network is an important category of graph in which every node is assigned to a layer and layers are drawn as parallel or radial lines. They are commonly used to display temporal data or hierarchical networks. Previous research has demonstrated that minimizing edge crossings is the most important criterion to consider when looking to improve the readability of such networks. While heuristic approaches exist for crossing minimization, we are interested in optimal approaches to the problem that prioritize human readability over computational scalability. We aim to improve the usefulness and applicability of such optimal methods by understanding and improving their scalability to larger graphs. This paper categorizes and evaluates the state-of-the-art linear programming formulations for exact crossing minimization and describes nine new and existing techniques that could plausibly accelerate the optimization algorithm. Through a computational evaluation, we explore each technique's effect on calculation time and how the techniques assist or inhibit one another, allowing researchers and practitioners to adapt them to the characteristics of their networks. Our best-performing techniques yielded a median improvement of 2.5--17x depending on the solver used, giving us the capability to create optimal layouts faster and for larger networks. We provide an open-source implementation of our methodology in Python, where users can pick which combination of techniques to enable according to their use case.

"Merge trees are a valuable tool in scientific visualization of scalar fields; however, current methods for merge tree comparisons are computationally expensive, primarily due to the exhaustive matching between tree nodes. To address this challenge, we introduce the merge tree neural networks (MTNN), a learned neural network model designed for merge tree comparison. The MTNN enables rapid and high-quality similarity computation. We first demonstrate how graph neural networks (GNNs), which emerged as an effective encoder for graphs, can be trained to produce embeddings of merge trees in vector spaces that enable efficient similarity comparison.  Next, we formulate the novel MTNN  model that further improves the similarity comparisons by integrating the tree and node embeddings with a new topological attention mechanism. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on real-world data in different domains and examine our model's generalizability across various datasets. Our experimental analysis demonstrates our approach's superiority in accuracy and efficiency. In particular, we speed up the prior state-of-the-art by more than 100x on the benchmark datasets while maintaining an error rate below 0.1%.",Rapid and Precise Topological Comparison with Merge Tree Neural Networks,,DTr,2024
"The importance of data charts is self-evident, given their ability to express complex data in a simple format that facilitates quick and easy comparisons, analysis, and consumption. However, the inherent visual nature of the charts creates barriers for people with visual impairments to reap the associated benefits to the same extent as their sighted peers. While extant research has predominantly focused on understanding and addressing these barriers for blind screen reader users, the needs of low-vision screen magnifier users have been largely overlooked. In an interview study, almost all low-vision participants stated that it was challenging to interact with data charts on small screen devices such as smartphones and tablets, even though they could technically “see” the chart content. They ascribed these challenges mainly to the magnification-induced loss of visual context that connected data points with each other and also with chart annotations, e.g., axis values. In this paper, we present a method that addresses this problem by automatically transforming charts that are typically non-interactive images into personalizable interactive charts which allow selective viewing of desired data points and preserve visual context as much as possible under screen enlargement. We evaluated our method in a usability study with 26 low-vision participants, who all performed a set of representative chart-related tasks under different study conditions. In the study, we observed that our method significantly improved the usability of charts over both the status quo screen magnifier and a state-of-the-art space compaction-based solution.",Towards Enhancing Low Vision Usability of Data Charts on Smartphones,,R&I,2024
