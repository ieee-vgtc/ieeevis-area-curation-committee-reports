Building on these findings, this work examines the cognitive load elicited by icon array, text formats and combined icon array and text formats during during Bayesian tasks. We used a three-pronged approach to capture a more nuanced picture of cognitive demand than prior work: measuring differences in working-memory capacity, utilizing a dual-task paradigm to observe behavior under divided attention, and collecting subjective ratings of self-reported effort. We found that individuals with low working memory capacity make fewer errors when using icon arrays compared to text. In addition to influencing accuracy, we also present evidence that the icon array and the combination formats elicit lower ratings of subjective workload compared to text. Altogether, our findings provide evidence that visualization elicits higher accuracy while exerting less cognitive demand compared to text alone. We believe that these findings can have a considerable impact on risk-communication and comprehension, especially for individuals with lower cognitive abilities."
