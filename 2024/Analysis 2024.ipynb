    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This report summarizes the findings, recommendations, and process by the VIS Area Curation Committee (ACC) regarding the areas and keywords used for paper submissions to IEEE VIS 2024. It is based on the 2021, 2022, and 2023 ACC committee reports, updated with the 2024 data. According to the Charter, the goal of this committee is to analyze and report how submissions made use of the areas and keywords to describe their contribution. It is important to understand when these descriptors no longer adequately cover the breadth of research presented at VIS.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use **submission and bidding information** from VIS 2024 to analyze recent trends following the move to an area model. We also conducted a **survey among authors who submitted to VIS about their satisfaction with the area model**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The full data and source code to rebuild this project are available [here](https://github.com/ieee-vgtc/ieeevis-area-curation-committee-reports).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Committee members 2024: Jean-Daniel Fekete (co-chair), Alexander Lex (co-chair), Helwig Hauser, Ingrid Hotz, David Laidlaw, Torsten Möller, Michael Papka, Danielle Szafir, Yingcai Wu. \n",
    "* Committee members 2023: Steven Drucker (chair), Jean-Daniel Fekete, Ingrid Hotz,  David Laidlaw, Alexander Lex, Torsten Möller, Michael Papka, Hendrik Strobelt, Shigeo Takahashi.\n",
    "* Committee members 2022: Steven Drucker (chair), Ingrid Hotz,  David Laidlaw, Heike Leitte, Torsten Möller, Carlos Scheidegger, Hendrik Strobelt, Shigeo Takahashi, Penny Rheingans.\n",

    "# Executive Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Overall, the area model appears to be successful.** \n",
    "* **There is substantial growth in the Application area** and we hence recommend to take action to address the load for APCs of the application area.\n",
    "* **Acceptance rates have declined this year,** caused by lower first-round acceptance rates and more than usual second-round rejects (some of which are likely [one-time effects](https://ieeevis.org/year/2024/blog/vis-2024-OPC-blog-decisions_2)).\n",
    "* **Variability of acceptance rates between areas is substantial.** \n",
    "\n",
    "Otherwise, our analysis suggests that submissions are relatively balanced across areas, keywords are (with a small exception) well distributed, and the unified PC appears to provide broad and overlapping coverage.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "The main issue that needs addressing for 2025 is the increasing size of the Applications area. The goal of area size is to be [approximately 100 submissions, with a lower bound of 50 and an upper bound of 150](https://ieeevis.org/year/2022/blog/vis-21-area-model). After several years of gradual growth, (2021: 100; 2023: 123), the application area has grown to 154 papers in 2024. The Systems & Rendering area is slightly above the lower bound with 51 papers, as is the Data Transformations area with 53 papers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We see three possible remedies for this uneven workload: \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: Area Split\n",
    "\n",
    "The most obvious choice would be to split the areas that have grown too large. While this would be sensible for areas with a \"natural\" fault line, like Theoretical and Empirical, it seems more fraught for Applications. It is unclear how a sensible split of Applications could be executed that is not confusing to authors. One possibility would be to split by application domain (e.g., Applications in AI/ML and all other Applications), but this would lead to ambiguity for a number of papers.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: Additional APCs for Large Areas\n",
    "\n",
    "The main motivation for keeping areas to similar sizes is to manage workload for APCs. An alternative approach to a split would be to add additional APCs for large areas (e.g., a third APC for applications). While it would reduce workload slightly, there are several downsides to this approach: \n",
    "\n",
    "* It would necessitate recruiting another senior researcher as an APC, and recruiting tends to be difficult. \n",
    "* It would grow the overall size of the APC while the number of papers is not growing substantially (it is still lower than in the outlier year 2020).\n",
    "* It might make decision-making more complicated. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 3: Introducing Secondary Areas and Moving Papers\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach would be to introduce a secondary area for all paper submissions, and then balance papers after the initial submission. Author feedback shows that a second-choice area would be desirable. \n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of this approach: \n",
    "* It could not only be used to alleviate issues in large areas, but also move papers to areas that do not receive enough submissions, creating an overall more balanced load.\n",
    "* It would be a relatively minor change from author's perspective. \n",
    "\n",
    "The downsides of this approach: \n",
    "* It adds an additional step to the review process. While papers are currently moved between areas on rare occasion, this would make this a standard part of the process.\n",
    "* Authors could be discontent if their paper isn't reviewed in their primary area.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The ACC currently favors Option 3 as it seems most promising in balancing areas. However, we recommend eliciting feedback from APCs and OPCs on these options.**\n"

    "# Survey Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Regarding authors satisfaction related to the areas from the IEEE VIS Areas Feedback Survey 2024:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For our survey, we received 103 responses. This is not a particularly high return rate, but it's a good absolute number.\n",
    "* We received most responses from authors, who submitted to areas 1 (theory...), 2 (applications), and 4 (representations...), and less from areas 3 (systems), 5 (data transformations), and 6 (analytics).\n",
    "* Very few (6) found that they could not find a suitable area, a fair share of the authors (25 of 103), however, state that they could also have submitted to another area.\n",
    "* 8 authors, who submitted to applications, would also have submitted to another area. \n",
    "* Area 6 came up most often as a possible alternative area.\n",
    "* At large, it seems that most authors do not see the immediate need to change the areas.\n",
    "* Quite a few of the authors (18 of 103) thought that area 4 needs an improvement. \n",
    "* Also quite a few (12) thought that area 6 should be improved.  \n",
    "* When asked regarding merging/splitting areas, \"splitting area 2 (applications)\" came up most often. \n",
    "* The authors sent a pretty strong signal that indicating a second-choice area would be welcome. "
